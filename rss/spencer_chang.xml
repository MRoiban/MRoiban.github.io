      <title>diluted stars, islands, civic tech, and üçú</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/diluted-stars-islands-civic-tech</link>
      <description>It‚Äôs been a while since my last post, and I keep pushing myself to do this write some reflections here more regularly in order to give myself an extra push of formalized and focused thinking time. I‚Äôm going to start experimenting soon with sharing out musings and recommendations each week from the content I‚Äôve been consuming and thoughts I‚Äôve been harboring. Would love for this to be a conduit for discussion and surfacing of new ideas and planning for it to evolve that way if all things go well.I‚Äôm currently writing this from the Big Island of Hawaii. Even as I write that it feels unreal, and I feel like I should be somewhat guilty for making the trip out here despite everything going on. Yet the government of Hawaii is going full-out on pushing tourism and evenencouraging remote workersto move here temporarily to put money into the local community. It‚Äôs a sharp contrast from what is normally seen on social media in putting down any attempt to travel (and surprisingly closer to what a lot of countries outside the U.S. are doing (seeJapan‚Äôs tentative plans to reopen). It seems like the narrative still has not changed from how it was in the beginning of the virus where it is either irresponsible to open anything (due to spreading the virus) or irresponsible to close everything (due to devastating the economy. I kind of hate myself for saying this, but it seems like we need a more nuanced perspective to be pervasive in society (although it might not get us anywhere in terms of policy since it is a more complex view). I heard an amazingpodcast episoderecently that featuredAudrey Tang, Taiwan‚Äôs new ‚Äúdigital minister,‚Äù where they described how their new post has enabled Taiwan to efficiently scale to the information challenges that COVID-19 presented. They set up a 24-hr hotline to ask questions about information which provided an avenue to quickly correct misinformation (using memes) and a community-driven website that scraped mask supplies from local pharmacies to alert locals to mask availability which eventually evolved into a full-fledged government-funded website with cooperation from the pharmacy corporations. It‚Äôs definitely worth a listen, and I‚Äôm left wondering how we can take some of these lessons and apply it at 10x population scale to the U.S.i made disI wrote anew pieceon stars, coffee, and open fields (recommend reading while listening to lo-fi beats if you want the full experience üòÑ). It was a bit of a surreal and dreamy experience and curious to hear how it made you feel.See the postI‚Äôve also been wanting to get into drawing, so this was a great opportunity to practice (I used Procreate on my iPad) with a vivid personal experience. I‚Äôm looking for tips and tutorials on how to get better at this if you have any!If any of this resonates or you just want to say hi, I would love tolisten and share!my musings lately:üé± play + inspiration:I loved playing Block Dude on the TI-83. I found out fromThe Dream Machinethat it was created by a user who programmed the calculator for fun, specifically to ‚Äúhelp other people get through those boring classes.‚Äù It‚Äôs crazy how something created for pure fun and curiosity became so popular and impactful, and it says a lot about the power of broadening the access for developing ‚Äúsoftware.‚Äù This is an extremely relevant area of thought for the things I do atCodatoo.üè† on the web:What is your ‚Äúhome‚Äù on the Internet? Is it a corporate website or is it something more personal? What space on the Internet feels unmistakably like yours? Thinking about how customization is core to identity and how we‚Äôve lost that as the Internet has increasingly commoditized and bundled.üí≠ communication mediums: most people prefer speech (specifically, in-person speech) as the medium of choice. What if speech became 15-20% (or some other significant threshold) more likely to result in errors or miscommunications? Would we abandon speech for text altogether? What would the threshold need to be for us to naturally self-correct?the fun box:I‚Äôm starting up a new tradition of including something fun (maybe often food) in every post to make this a little more personal.I made garlic noodles for the fam last night followingone of my favorite recipes from J Kenjiand spiced it up by adding crab meat, eggplant, daikon, and some asiago. I think the daikon ended up being a little lost unfortunately„Éºthink I may have had to season them by themselves a little more instead of just relying on the sauce.As always with gratitude,SpencerShare Bridging Paradoxes and Discovering Beauty</description>

      <title>towards 2021</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/towards-2021</link>
      <description>this is an occasional compilation of my thoughts and curiosities. If you find the thoughts or resources interesting and want to receive more, you cansubscribe here.sf on fire however long ago, covid-time feels like a lifetimeHi all, hope everyone had a restful holiday season despite the fact that the craziness of 2020 is following us into 2021. As much as the weight of the feeling that the world is actively crumbling around us, I've been trying my best to be fully present to enjoy time with family at home, stay focused at work with 2 new engineers joining my team, and, as an escapist mechanism, consuming trash tv (Schitt's Creek, although it actually has some noticeable character development which is nice). I just got back to San Francisco after being away for almost 2 months, and the sudden shift from the bustling, normal-like ambiance of Houston to the ghost-town-esque streets of downtown SF is dizzying, even as both places see COVID cases spike. It almost feels like we‚Äôre stuck in a loop, returning to a year ago when we first began the lockdown: empty streets dimly lit by rows of street lamps, wisps of light forming apparitions of the mind showing the Saturday night bustle of a different lifetime. I'm hoping for the best with the vaccine rollout and getting the virus under control to a point where life can start to feel less suffocating and a constant decision between what is right or wrong.‚úçÔ∏è In writing land, I recently wrote about mycommitment to 2021to trusting myself to take risks, in other words, to gamble. Would love to hear tips for what has worked or stories of similar undertakings in order if it sparks any ideas :)on gamblingrecent musingsü™û our different selves:I've been thinking a lot about the phenomenon of people having different identities with different groups. As a simple example, imagine how your behavior changes depending on whether you‚Äôre with your parents, your friends, your coworkers. The air changes depending on who you‚Äôre with, where you are, what you‚Äôre doing and coalesces around something that‚Äôs appropriate for all those things. In this sense, we‚Äôre fluid beings and are constantly adapting to tiny perturbations in our surroundings to maximize our survival. One common coalescing center is through including everyone, which involves bringing any group dynamic to the most common denominator of "eligible" topics. Upon first glance, this seems like a good adaptation, but it causes a direct conflict with the principle of authentic expression, which involves allowing anyone to fully express their identity even if it means topics that not everyone will understand (a form of exclusion), whether it be family background or cultural references. In some cases, we feel ourselves transforming into a version that hides our authentic, at-rest (what I've come to start callingnull self, in a play on the null hypothesis) identity. If you've ever felt an internal conflict of returning to your high school environment and home or the pressure to stop sharing a personal experience as your boss walks into the room, you've experienced this pressure to conform to the "normal" standards of society (Interior Chinatownsatirizes this as the pressure on Asian-American actors to become ‚Äúkung fu guy‚Äù). Of course,power dynamicsplays a big role in causing people to conform to certain kinds of behavior. However, we also see this play out at a larger scale across America. For example in recent perturbations from the conflict in our world, the BLM protests and the insurrection at the Capitol are both examples of some segment of society fighting against the pressure to conform that they experience (a society that has been structured to mistreat black and brown people vs. a society that is becoming diverse and globalized). Within the segment, there's also an overwhelming pressure to conform to the segment's dogma, and the very air propels you towards this shared group identity (Eric Hoffer inThe True Believerdescribes this as ‚Äúself-renunciation‚Äù). In some ways, it‚Äôs freeing to just let the tide push you instead of constantly fighting to express yourself. In other ways, becoming part of the tide is the same as disappearing‚Äîyour individual self consumed by the ‚Äúconsummate‚Äù whole. There are certainly domestic terrorists and other deliberate instigators that were part of the mob on Wednesday, but it's just as certain that there are a significant amount of others that followed along because they saw themselves as defenders of liberty, and it was the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù choice given. What's the right balance of adapting your identity to your environment and maintaining yournull selfand how do you cultivate a default to express yournull selfrather than conforming to the easy path? What's societal norms will allow us to promote self-expression while giving opportunities for people to connect and engage at a fundamentally human level? How can we change the default environments of society so that people grow up appreciating diversity and wanting to understand others? What even are the defaults that we want society to instill in people? If it were up to me, I‚Äôd get more people to listen to understand rather than to argue, to appreciate the joys granted by the simple things rather than constantly striving for thenext big thing, to love and laugh and cherish as if they are freely produced rather than reserved for a special occasion.ü¶Ñ  purpose of fiction:I've also been enjoying a lot of fiction writing lately and thinking about how it involves weaving a story in order to demonstrate some principle (conventionally referred to as the "moral of the story"). Fiction is crafting stories that blend enough elements of reality with a compelling narrative to demonstrate some belief in an understandable and sympathetic manner, a subtle shifting of readers' perspectives towards that of the principle. Ted Chiang, author of some fantastical short stories, calls this writing ‚Äústories that literalize metaphors‚Äù. It reminds me of a philosophy in product development of building prototypes that demonstrate an extreme point of view (a principle that was formalized to me by Lane, Coda‚Äôs head of product) in order to smoke-test the underlying assumption or principle for how the product should behave and how it influences users to act.üî®balancing niche with shared understanding:Another phenomenon on my mind is thepassion economy/ creator economy and how it's going to evolve moving forward. The thesis is that our economy is increasingly moving towards one that encourages people to be financially independent from a company through their personality and creative pursuits. We saw this originally happen with platforms like Youtube and Instagram, although the dynamics of those platforms produce superstars, people who were known to all users of the platform. Now, we're seeing smaller players emerge with sustainable lifestyles without having to win over millions of users, just1000 true fans. This phenomenon plays out on platforms like Twitch, Patreon, OnlyFans, etc. There's less of an emphasis on needing to appeal broadly to a massive audience; instead, you are rewarded for focusing on a very specific niche that will appeal strongly to a small audience. We see this also in the rise of media sites that are deliberately catered to a specific political bent, ex: breitbart and nowthis. And here at Coda, it's something we'rebanking on too, that catered niche software will always work better than one-size-fits-all general software. Li Jin from a16z posits the idea of creating amiddle class for the creator economyand what is needed to get more and more creators to achieve the 1000 true fans needed for sustainability rather than shooting for a million fans. One structural problem that emerges in my mind that requires a novel solution for this world to work is information overload. As of now, there's already so much content and content creators that one can consume and subscribe to, that we mostly let the algorithmic feeds of social media and content platforms serve us what they think we want to see. How can we solve the problem of discoverability for an exponential increase in creators while ensuring that people aren't overwhelmed with options (free choice paradox)? Another question it brings to mind is: do we want this to be the default for our future society? The proliferation of the niche is incentivizing people to value niche-ness, in of itself, andembodying principles to the extreme, rendering coming together to form consensus on some universal foundations unnecessary. A focus on individual creators can also lead to a very American-dream-esque call to action, a message that ‚Äúyou can empower yourself by creating‚Äù while still cultivating a dynamic that causes the largest winners to take the lion‚Äôs share of benefits. Is there a way to form a system that allows any creator to rise to sustainability through their work without requiring creators to ‚Äúplay the game‚Äù of social media platforms to gain virality?some more reading:Working in Public by Nadia EghbalIs Substack the Media Future We Want?No Meetings, No Deadlines, No Full-Time Employeessome things I enjoyed consuminga sun(ÈôΩÂÖâÊôÆÁÖß): a gripping, emotional, and powerful Taiwanese movie that is available on NetflixInterior Chinatown: as my hastily writtengoodreads reviewstates, "Wow this book left me speechless.

      <title>2 - vibe tribes and finding psychological oxygen</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/vibe-tribes</link>
      <description>editorial note: I started the makings of this post a few weeks ago when I was home in Houston and decided to publish it now, so the ‚Äútoday‚Äù is then.LA has a particular default vibe (see more at myinstagram)While writing today and listening to some lo-fi, I was struck by an intense sense of nostalgia for my days in high school. There‚Äôs something about the cool air of the AC unit mingling with the residual anxiety of flying in COVID-world that reminded me of hot Houston summers sitting in class and dreading the next thing on my schedule (perhaps the biggest factor was I was with my parents in Houston because ourpresent selves are highly contextual). High school me lived in perpetual fear of the new and the next and the future. I was basically in survival mode all the time. I felt suffocated by the pressure and restrained by the expectations.I got good grades and did the ‚Äúright‚Äù things with extracurriculars and volunteering and so on and so forth primarily out of an instinct for survival rather than out of a genuine curiosity or a desire for fun. I rarely felt at peace and comforted in my day-to-day at that time. Survival mode is synonymous with scarcity mindset in a lot of ways. You narrow your focus to optimize for one key objective and ruthlessly cut anything out if it doesn‚Äôt meet the heuristic for what is necessary to keep moving forward. It meant feelings like enjoying that creative writing exercise or hating running for the sake of competition or relishing video games were unacceptable. When they appeared, those feelings were quickly cut off from the main body, quarantined before the main population was corrupted.I‚Äôve been thinking lately about the concept ofpsychological oxygen. It‚Äôs a concept from Jan T√∏nnesvang which essentially describes the state where all your mental needs have been met and you‚Äôre free to freely express your creativity and authentic expressions as desired. This is the mental state of abundance, the opposite of a state of survival and of scarcity. It describes a state where you‚Äôre not only able but also encouraged to pursue and accept your honest desires, feelings, and instincts. It‚Äôs a state of rest for your mind ‚Äî the baseline requirement for any attempt to ascend beyond your current self‚Äôs capabilities.Spencer Chang@spencerc99Jan T√∏nnesvang‚Äôs concept of ‚Äúpsychological oxygen‚Äù has stuck with me which characterizes the state where your innate human needs are met and you can embrace an abundance mindset rather than being stuck in mental scarcity4:04 PM ‚àô Mar 17, 2021I‚Äôm realizing that the education system in America does a pretty poor job of providing psychological oxygen. Everything from what you choose to do in your free time to who you hang out with to which test prep booklet you buy to the prestige and connections of the club teacher to word #357 on college essay #23 for application #6 is immensely important, life-or-death important, in fact. This mindset is what natural selection optimizes for in our education system. Success is measured by whether you got into the top 20 schools (regardless of how well they fit your personal educational desires). The ones who ‚Äúget it‚Äù and learn how to play the game do well and go on to form the role models for the next set of candidates. They‚Äôre the ones that parents tell their children to learn from, to be more like, the role models of society that made it. It pays to understand the mechanics of the game (techniques to maximize score in standardized testing, optimizing AP studying to avoid marginal returns above the 4/5 threshold, getting the right sound bites for your club officer titles, and making friendly connections with the right sorts of people who can put the word in the right sorts of places). And it pays to be paid well for understanding the game. And of course, it‚Äôs much easier if your family already understands the shape of the game of society.I saw this dynamic exemplified inOperation Varsity Blues,a documentary on the college admissions scandal of 2019, where a college admissions coach coordinated ‚Äúside doors‚Äù for guaranteed admission into aforementioned exclusive universities. Well-known families paid the low cost of hundreds of thousands to guarantee admission for their students (as opposed to the sanctioned ‚Äúback door‚Äù of donating ~$50 million). I wasn‚Äôt struck so much by these parents‚Äô criminal instincts rather than the intensity of their perception of the necessity of the prestige of going to an exclusive college was. This is all part of the cemented myth of accreditation, where people are striving to go to exclusive colleges for the very fact that they are exclusive rather than for any other match to learning propensities. We‚Äôve been conditioned to live to mimic a narrative that society deems correct rather than to live according to our own feelings. Life is a performance and we are the actors and actresses that have a proper role to play for the show to go on, especially if we want to move up to a bigger role.However, one positive side effect from this environment is that exclusivity and desire and a ruthless competition for spots also turns out to collect a set of driven, passionate, and (sometimes) kind people. Even if you have to play the game, it takes work to do it properly, so naturally the people who come in have passed some bar for capability to produce effort. Because of this, even if you recognize the myth, you still have to play the game to get there because it‚Äôs where thescenesare. I‚Äôve started to call the process of finding these sorts of ¬†scenes that you can involve yourself in, feel inspired by, and feel safe to contribute experimentallyfinding your vibe tribe. The particulars of the environment (the classes, the city, the dining) are important too, but they are mere details compared to the vibe of the people and the energy that you feel in a place. And it turns out that these exclusive universities have a great scene for energy and passion. Is this true for other lesser-known colleges and it‚Äôs just not as well-advertised, and if not, how can you bring this kind of scene to every educational campus?And instead of framing success around the acquisition of a scarce set of credentials, what if we thought about success as finding this community of people that provides you the psychological oxygen?Lisa Wehden@LisaWehdenConvinced 95% of being successful is just finding people you vibe with4:11 AM ‚àô Mar 17, 20214,692Likes381RetweetsI wonder: what would it look like for an education system to provide psychological oxygen by default? A place that is a safe space for students to freely pursue their passion and their intuitions and their curiosities. And when I say safe space, I don‚Äôt mean a place where conflict is avoided and monotony is encouraged but rather a place where conflict is given the proper space to air in a healthy manner, here the exchange of ideas is free and passionate and promoted, where diversity of opinion is welcomed inherently because of the newness it brings and where it‚Äôs safe to assume people are of good intent and push people towards committing actually good action.(i had a tweet here that said something to the effect of ‚Äúa conflict-free space is the opposite of a safe space‚Äù but looks like it‚Äôs been taken down, so pretend this is the tweet).This is what a vibe tribe is for, a space that fosters psychological oxygen by default. A community where you can be yourself and feel encouraged rather than pressured to create and express yourself authentically. A space where you can be gently inspired towards self-actualization (a ‚Äúgentle inspired start‚Äù fromJohn Maeda).College is where people try to find their vibe tribe because there‚Äôs this perception that you meet no new friends outside of college. While it is certainly much much harder, I think that perception is self-defeating and almost makes it taboo to venture out beyond the traditional gathering places and rituals of recent graduates. The new grad bubble takes hold through house warmings and new hire bootcamp classes as the barrier to taking the leap into something new and unknown grows ever higher.Nathan Baschez@nbashawWorking theory:

‚ÄúInterest in topics‚Äù is a weak force.

‚ÄúAttraction to vibes‚Äù (micro-patterns of expression) is a strong force.4:06 AM ‚àô Apr 11, 202163Likes3RetweetsI would love if the dynamic shifted to encourage this kind of thing more. We should normalize going to an event or participating in an activity that is completely outside the realm of normal consideration. I remember discussing with Raymond this idea ofbubble hopping(the podcast describes someone who started a tradition of polling a random event from Facebook and attend it regularly, a particularly poignant example involving a Russian family‚Äôs birthday party) and wanting to try it out once we moved to SF, but we never got around to committing. I‚Äôm hoping to be able to dust off and apply this experiment in a post-vaccine society.Because we‚Äôre limited in our outlets for discovering vibes in our community, more and more people are venturing out on social media outlets like Twitter to find their vibe tribe online. It‚Äôs also why people are taking the gamble in showing very honest vignettes of themselves online, risking shame and ostracization for finding new tribe members. This raw, honest display acts like a platonic mating call or an SOS signal for friends. It‚Äôs a signal for your vibe, shining a bunch of lights into the vast digital ether of thoughts and feelings and attacks and memes in the hope that some set of people will see it, vibe with it, and reach out to dive into something you put into the world.It‚Äôs these fleeting opportunities for connection that provide infinite returns on investment because it involves such little effort to be potentially rewarded. There‚Äôs no pressure that youhaveto vibe or get along, it‚Äôs just opening the door to allow it to happen. It‚Äôs making yourself available to the maximal amount of opportunities.

Slightly higher psychological oxygen as a result but still a barrier to postingsmall group chats / 1:1 DMs: high psychological oxygen space when it‚Äôs someone you‚Äôre very close to, no filter,This intersection between something completely public (ala Twitter) and things that feel more intimate (like Discord, Dialup, small group chats / 1:1 DMs) has been fascinating to me lately.

      <title>3 - the superpower of naming</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/the-superpower-of-naming</link>
      <description>some bark in Tahoe. I called this one ‚ÄúLeafy Invaders.‚Äù How did that reshape your interpretation of this photo? (more on myinstagram)I find it fascinating that so many projects start with figuring out the name for the thing. The satirical flavor of this is securing the domain name for the project before work has even begun. Perhaps it can be used as a sign of whether it‚Äôs meant to be: if the domain name is available or not. Astrological building, divining the heavenly signs from the DNS registrars.As easy as this is to make fun of, names are crucially important to the essence of what something is. It‚Äôs the first thing that people interpret and the perpetual mental handle for referencing later. It‚Äôs the metaphorical file cabinet in your mental library which you automatically shuttle any new related thoughts into. Imagine trying to make it common knowledge that blackberries aren‚Äôt, in fact, berries. It somehow just feels wrong and counter to what you body feels.This sort of mechanism we use to reference things also makes renaming terribly difficult. You have to suddenly teach your mind to reroute everything that used to go to the old folder to a new one and reshape your entire mental model of the original idea. It can be hard to phase out the original phrases. You see examples of this in trying to change culture for common terms, like phasing out the term‚Äúmaster‚Äù for ‚Äúmain‚Äùin Github branches or insisting thatsushi is toast. If you make it far enough, you can create meaning for a name where there was none before, asGoogleandAirbnbandKleenexhave seeped into pores of our societal language.Sometimes when I‚Äôm in the grocery store searching for something judge on the edge of different named categories, I wonder about how these standards for categorizing things in large stores were even formed. For example, who decided that ‚Äúpeanut butter‚Äù deserved to be it‚Äôs own category or that tahini is actually a form of ‚Äúpeanut butter‚Äù rather than a ‚Äúsauce‚Äù or a ‚Äúcondiment.‚Äù It turns out that while we have a lot of common associations with things, trying to group any large set of things into mutually exclusive groups is impossible to do efficiently. Designing a taxonomy that isMECE(mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, which is a fancy way of saying every item belongs in one group and all items are covered) becomes more and more of an impossible task the larger the set of items grows because everyone‚Äôs associations are slightly different. I got a taste of this trouble with mywork on the knowledge graph at Airbnb, but the problem grows ever more insurmountable when you start bringing in all realms of human knowledge in.The problem with trying to do this sort of neat, organized bucketing is that the categories themselves are names, and names are rough maps of concepts. Themap is not the territory, and names are a prime example of that. The benefit of naming is the same as its con. Naming things gives your brain a handle to something simple to use as a bookmark, a shortcut to a mental space. This naturally means that it loses the richness and the depth of the encapsulated content. In naming, we map an abstract blob into a concrete symbol, the continuous into the discrete.Because of the automatic interpretation we do with names, it also means names are dramatically important for how the idea it names gets interpreted and perceived. Packaging the same idea in a different name could yield drastically different results. We spend hours workshopping and namestorming and millions on marketing because thenameis so crucial to how we‚Äôre perceived. And the instant perception of something in a world where the instant perception is multiplied and spread everywhere in an instant on social media is life-or-death important. I‚Äôve seen this tension in having to package what I build into a form that resonates with the target audience. What we build is moldable. It‚Äôs like idea Playdough‚Äîyou can shape it into different forms that will resonate with different sorts of people. Names are the spearhead‚Äîthe front desk for your idea that sets the environment for the rest of your content. And that spearhead can be used for good or for bad, in the end it‚Äôs a method of manipulating people to believe the way you want them to. For example,BP manufactured the ‚Äúcarbon footprint‚Äùnameto shift the blame for climate change to individuals away from companies. It was a sickening and brilliant battle strategy. The name set the scene for individuals bearing the blame and individuals needing to rally to provide solace. Oil companies were able to donate money and host charity events and champion individual change campaigns as mitigation measures.This sort of manipulative action, which when caught sparks massive controversy, brings me to another inseparable aspect of naming. Names are the spoils of war. They say ‚Äúhistory is written by the winner‚Äù because the winner in any struggle decides how it‚Äôs named, how it‚Äôs told. Much like scarce resources and weapons of mass destruction were catalysts for physical war in the past, names are the spoils fought over the in the internet and social media trenches today. John Palmer talks about the narrative wars that are fought now inScissor Labels. From his post: ‚ÄúAscissor labelis a word or phrase that, for the first time, establishes a widely embraced name for a trend without simultaneously establishing a canonical definition. It is a vague term masquerading as a specific one, where the missing definition is still up for grabs.‚Äù Scissor labels are the names most ripe for fighting because they represent the most upside. Securing ownership of the label is like securing the perimeter of oil-rich land. Once it‚Äôs yours, you have the capacity to exploit it as you wish.Even when a name is established, it‚Äôs the basis for identifying who belongs and who doesn‚Äôt. I remember a vivid instance of this. I was a junior in college when we first made a Rice Computer Science Community Slack which included both alumni and current students, and I was setting up the various Slack channels, including those for different locations: #seattle, #nyc #sanfran... Immediately after I created the #sanfran channel and added folks, I received countless messages asking to change the name and making fun of the initial name.A surveyconfirms that ‚ÄúThe City‚Äù or ‚ÄúSF‚Äù is the acceptable way of calling the city, and my use of the term ‚ÄúSan Fran‚Äù clearly marked me as an outsider of the given community. It‚Äôs similar to the concept of asking the codeword as a test for gaining entry to speakeasies, exclusive gatherings, and secret societies (Iroh entering the White Lotus safe house in ATLA comes to mind).Popular literature also loves to do iterations on this phenomenon. Ted Chiang in his short storySeventy-Two Lettersextends nomenclature, the science of naming, into the seminal science of society. In the story, the science of naming is literally the science of creation, man‚Äôs pathway to replicating God‚Äôs original creation act by providing a language to imbue inanimate objects with souls: in essence, creating life from nothing. Patrick Rothfuss inThe Name of the Windcrafts a magical world where nomenclature is one of the most powerful and mysterious skills. Kvothe, the protagonist learns the titular name of the wind, one of the most powerful names of which only a select few have ever known. InLiteromancer,Ken Liu tells the story of an old man who can craft magic from Chinese characters by picking apart the meanings of their different strokes: ‚ÄúEven after so many men died because of a few magic words, we continue to have faith in the power of words to do good.‚ÄùThis is the3rdinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>4 - samishii and nostalgia</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/samishii-and-nostalgia</link>
      <description>harvest moon in Gyeongju, South Korea (more on myinstagram)Biking around the streets of SF at night is always interesting (once I numbed to the fact that there are a bunch of crazy drivers here that have and will take out bikers). Something about traveling through the lifeblood of a city at night seems to enhance the nostalgia of everything around. Especially with the city coming back to live from the pandemic, the newly formed image of the city alive once again, but different, with the outdoor parklets and permanently shuttered favorites, sharply contrasts to the ghost town of a couple months ago. Because of the sudden change, it feels as if the apparitions of the past haunt the places where I've been‚Äîmy memories tangled with the emptiness and the new, yet changed, energy. It feels like a different life time from the time before when I went. The tinges of the past color these physical places even as they change and shift beyond recognition. I pass the old dance studio, a converted warehouse with a single makeshift doorway set into the white painted wall. If I focus closely enough, I can see through the darkened street, into the open class space, the heat and perspiration of human dynamism fogging up the mirror glass. I pass the intersection of my former home, where the ever-shifting homeless camp set up tent for some respite before another forced migration, bright-eyed volunteers in bright red and white and blue t-shirts set out plastic tables and foldable chairs to get the vote out for the local elections, and I hurried past on early mornings (hopefully not in boots) to my bus stop to catch the 49, all the while frantically checking to make sure I had my badge, occasionally doing a light jog timed to the real-time schedule updates on my 3rd party bus app.I can forget everything descriptive about a place: the name, the vibe, even the experience, except for when I come across it in physical world and something just feels familiar and nostalgic. It's as if a piece of it has stayed with me from the time, no matter how little, I've spent there, and the longer I spend the larger that piece grows. As I put myself into the world and leave breadcrumbs of myself, these places also take a piece of me, imbued into its aura, and in this way, we form a bond to each other, person to place. I've written about the concept ofdilutionbefore, the phenomenon of becoming more and more like the world around us as we expose ourselves to it and interact with it and simultaneously the world adopting more and more of us. Our bodies see and touch and taste, while our minds transmit and translate and process, while our souls experience and impress and connect. Each piece plays a part in bringing together a supernatural yet so so real moment. A present unlike any other, so abundant in detail, so deep in texture, so rich in flavor. We reach out with our consciousness to touch the Universe, and it touches us back in unexpected ways.Samishii(„Åï„Åø„Åó„ÅÑ) is a Japanese word for loneliness and emptiness. Specifically, I got interested in this term fromthis videowhere people use that term to describe the sort of loneliness that feels like a layer of emptiness has settled over an area. It‚Äôs as if the place has been trapped inside a heavy blanket, the liveliness dampened by default. The quiet streets of SF at night put me in a state, halfway between reality and the imaginary, where it feels as if I can recognize this layer sitting underneath the surface. The nostalgia bubbles riding to the surface to pop windows into the past. The dark water absorbing sound and life and inertia, designed to maintain the calm, the status quo. Sometimes this quiet, nostalgic state of mind is nice: long meandering walks along a paved park path traveling from beacon to beacon, sitting on a cool bed of sand listening to the waves sway and rise and retreat, the inhale and the exhale of the ocean and the moon, lying on a fluffy blanket nestled into a rockface with the limitless hubs of life and light and color dancing through the vast night sky. In the city, under the context of the recent devestation of COVID, it feels different. It feels like a reminder of how low we were brought‚Äîa constant fight to keep us anchored to the fear and uncertainty and shame that clouded our early quarantine days. I don‚Äôt want to be controlled by that fear or uncertainty or shame any longer, and it feels wrong to constantly bring things back to that frame of reference even as our courage is growing and our certainty is strengthening and our awareness is solidifying. We‚Äôre hardy, and we‚Äôve adapted despite the tragic losses along the way. Although there‚Äôs lots of petty things we struggle with, that‚Äôs one thing we humans are good at. I‚Äôm ready to adapt to escape thesamishii,to reclaim the present and the joy and the energy that is ours.This is the4thinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>5 - why do uncomfortable chairs exist?</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/why-do-uncomfortable-chairs-exist</link>
      <description>How is it that after thousands of years of humans opting to build things for their butts to rest on rather than using the ground, comfortable yet functional seating is still uncommon, rare even.a Herman Miller Aeron chairIt‚Äôs shocking and amusing how varied the shortcomings are, too. In the wide world, with everything from stools to benches and office chairs to armless swivel chairs and you might find...‚ÄúArm day only‚ÄùElegant, suave, leather-bound high tops without accessible footrests, leaving your feet dangling just out of reach of the ground, subjecting your butt to the entire weight of your body‚ÄúTwo-face‚Äùdesign-forward lounge chairs with a generous surface area to enjoy which looks oh so inviting, yet upon a nice plopping onto, a lively recoil slams you back rather than the expected cozy squish.‚ÄúMismatched pair‚Äùshort squat armchairs matched with tall table tops, where you‚Äôre forced to sit on the edge of the chair and your brain tries to convince you you‚Äôre set up ergonomicallyFromThe Tyranny of Chairs:Chairs are generally not a response to the realities of the body, its natural evolution, or its needs over any extended period. Instead, the industrialised body has devolved in its needs and succumbed to chairs. ‚ÄúWe design them,‚Äù Cranz writes, repurposing a famous line of Winston Churchill‚Äôs, ‚Äúbut once built, they shape us.‚ÄùIt seems the problem is that we‚Äôve established a mental model of how chairs ‚Äúshould‚Äù be and the way they ‚Äúshould‚Äù be or look is in conflict with how they actually need to in order to be comfortable and ergonomic and functional. The article continues:It‚Äôs not just chairs, of course ‚Äì so many of the products brought to market by the profession of industrial design were not created for many bodies. Instead, they were designed to be plentiful, novel rather than necessary, and cheap. One famous designer, Victor Papanek, memorably dubbed these bad designs a form of ‚Äúdo-it-yourself murder‚Äù.A do-it-yourself murder is an apt description for a lot of human industry in general. Every day our endeavors push us closer to the brink, we produce an overabundance of under desired goods designed to be replaced. We obsess over production‚Äîover the new and the sleek and the futuristic. V2 is always fancier and shinier than v1 and regardless of the material differences (even when the product becomes worse!), we still have a subconscious desire to upgrade. Products aren‚Äôt designed for people to play with and adjust to their own needs‚Äîthey‚Äôre optimized to sell and leave the user wanting more. After all, the most successful business is the addictive substances business, where every use leaves you craving ever more. We seek to replicate this strategy in a more subtle way in our consumer culture. Our products aim to please and dazzle with smooth demos but always leave out a core piece that can be satisfied by a future release. This trend has gone down over the years since the passion following the inception of mass industrialization as designers have advocated for more universal design, but rarely do you find it in accessible forms. The gold standard for ‚Äúseating done right‚Äù is the Herman Miller Aeron which sits at a steep $995 price tag for the most basic model. Perhaps the real issue isn‚Äôt the price point rather than the fact that we‚Äôve been anchored to unsustainably low price pointers while wages have stagnated for a majority of jobs. I don‚Äôt know all the details of the historical phenomenon to me, but it‚Äôs strange that well-designed, built-to-last versions of common tools are still inaccessible to so many....[This is what] Papanek called ‚Äúthe dark twins of styling and obsolescence‚Äù. Manufacturing for styling, amplified by advertising, resulted in an empty desire for unnecessary objects that became quickly unusable. And objects that were created purely for ephemeral desire, in turn, created a whole ethos of obsolescence ‚Äì an accepted disposability that made for a dangerous neglect of safety standards, resulting in needless injury from common household objectsWhat would it be like if there were simple analog levers in every chair to adjust to your liking? What if we rejected designing en mass for an average joe in favor of designing intentionally for the average joe to make what works for them? What if all of our products were made to last and designed to be adaptable to changing conditions?Can we create a society that can support access to these kinds of tools for every member, where tinkering is not only accepted but encouraged? We can start with the culture around ephemeral desire and slowly shift it to favor lasting stability, and at the same time, we must champion policies that enable greater access to a sustainable style of living over a disposable one.This is the5thinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>6 - shaping the world</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/shaping-the-world</link>
      <description>I was listening toThe Art of Zen and Motorcycle Maintenancethis morning on a bike ride and at one point, the narrator talks about how even though his comrades know they would save a lot of money and frustration if they learned how to maintain their motorcycle themselves, they refuse to try to learn or even question the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù direction from the dealers and the manual. Even though they are capable people in every other way, when it comes to problems with the motorcycle, they stubbornly repeat the same directions over and over while building up more and more frustration instead of prying a little bit deeper to try to derive what is actually happening. Throughout our lives, in our gold stars and perfect marks and tests on memorization and pattern matching, we‚Äôve been conditioned to think that there‚Äôs a‚Äúproper‚Äù wayof doing things and going through life. That attitude that got us through our educations seeps into our relationships with our tools. We‚Äôve been trained to trust the organization that represents the creators and the official manual and grow wary when anyone suggests a DIY fix, as if they‚Äôre pandering snake oil.hand markings in Zion (more on myinstagram)Ironically, this same morning, I realized that I wasn‚Äôt filling up my bike wheel properly because I didn‚Äôt actually know the right way to do it. I could‚Äôve easily figured this out from some common sense digging (no air was coming out from the valve), but I didn‚Äôt because I was scared of digging into the guts of it. Even as my mind was telling me it‚Äôd be better to just try some things out or at least do some Googling, my body just wanted it to work. Newly bought products especially fall into this category of things that feel like they should just work perfectly without defects in our perfection-focused consumer culture. From throwing out perfectly good but unaesthetic produce to creating fashion-forward but fullydysfunctional chairs, our industries pump out perfect-looking yet brittle goods at a scary scale.In this case, anyone who knew what they were doing could have pointed out my mistake because it was such a minor example, but there are a lot of instances where the people we have transferred responsibility to, like our politicians or our teachers, don‚Äôt actually know the right answer. In those cases, we‚Äôve created a culture where you‚Äôre not only incentivized but actually compelled out of survival instinct to speak with complete certainty about an answer, even when no one really knows. We‚Äôve created a power hierarchy where absolute truth flows from the top, and we‚Äôre expected to take that truth as the dogma on which to base our lives on.Whether it‚Äôs trying to understand what‚Äôs going on with a motorcycle that won‚Äôt start, diagnosing a toilet with increasingly lower water pressure, or even fixing all the annoying little things our computer does, like opening Docker on startup, there‚Äôs innumerable instances of varying intimidation levels where we‚Äôre presented with the opportunity to dig into the provided tool if we can muster the courage to. By default, there seems to be a deep-seated aversion to peeking under the hood of these tools, as if they‚Äôre the property of a prestigious guild and we have no right to even consider how they function. It‚Äôs as if we need to show our graciousness for having access to these enablers rather than question where they don‚Äôt work.We give the power of change over to christened ‚Äúoperators,‚Äù to the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù that know what they‚Äôre talking about, to ‚Äúthe chosen‚Äù keepers of the forbidden arcane arts. Even as we are overcome with intense frustration and sometimes rage when our machines behave unexpectedly or break suddenly, we struggle to escapeour dreadof looking under the cover. Why do we accept this mode of powerlessness with these systems even when we could make things different? Perhaps we‚Äôre scared of finding a truth that we won‚Äôt want to see, scared to find that our trust in the stability of how things work, the pillars that hold up our trust in our systems, is actually misplaced in a towering house of cards. We‚Äôre terrified of the possibility that we are incapable of affecting change, that our will is meaningless in our systematically controlled society where the future is determined from the start. Lest we startdistrusting all of our institutions and social contracts, we must bury the thought experiment in the name of self-preservation and continue believing in the infallibility of our tools and machines. And so we stick our heads in the sand and do our best to embrace blissful ignorance as a defense mechanism, even when that ignorance hurts like hell when our systems and contracts fail us.Now we see how we end up in this vicious cycle of wanting to trust in fallible operators, finding that their teachings are imperfect, and confronting an existential struggle around knowing things are broken but at the same time, being afraid of digging in deeper to see what we want to find. But can we escape this extreme dichotomy between trusting wholeheartedly and bearing extreme cognitive dissonance when things break and distrusting everything to the point that you can‚Äôt operate normally?A more sustainable way to resolve these complications is accepting the awareness that no one knows everything that‚Äôs happening‚Äîwe‚Äôre all just giving our best efforts, and that kind of magic knowledge of ‚Äúhow things work‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exist in the realm of human-made things. They‚Äôre simply collections of pieces of logic put together in a certain combination. If we wanted to, we could pick them apart, separate each individual piece from the complicated whole, and go through each piece and group sequentially until we understood all the different pieces. Of course, understanding how all the individual pieces work and what they should do doesn‚Äôt mean we have perfect knowledge of what can or will happen when they all work in tandem. The infinite set of events that can occur in a dynamic system is beyond what our minds can compute upfront, and so even the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù in realms can‚Äôt know the ultimate answers before trying things out.Once we understand that no one really knows what they‚Äôre doing, how everyone is, in a sense, performing for the role they play, we need to build the courage to tinker. The official definition oftinkeris ‚Äúto repair, adjust, or work with something in an unskilled or experimental manner‚Äù while atinkerin medieval times was used to refer to a traveling merchant who carried miscellaneous goods and can repair goods. In the same way, we need to rebuild the courage tofidgetandplaywith our tools and create more tools that are designed for this mode of use rather than the standard single-function ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù mode of operation. We needmalleable systemsthat we can change and mold to our needs and wants as opposed to the traditional pyramid of power where truth flows down.We need to feel ownership in the tools and systems that control our daily lives for us to take to heart the belief that we have the capacity to contribute and change things. We need to believe that we can change our reality if we‚Äôre willing to muster the courage to try. And we need to realize that changingourreality is as good as changingrealityitself. With that, we‚Äôll unlock the power to shape the world before us.leftover open questions:How do we shift our culture meaningfully in a way that promotes this sort of mentality over the default of powerlessness?How can we incentivize companies and organizations to create tools and systems that open vectors for tinkering?What are ways for us to empower those that are not traditionally knighted as chosen operators of these tools?This is the6thinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>7 - zoom fatigue and low pressure contexts</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/zoom-fatigue-and-low-pressure-contexts</link>
      <description>Our current digital social contexts force us to be ‚Äúalways on.‚Äù Slack, Email, and even newcomers like Clubhouse increasingly optimize for a communication flow that is synchronous, which requires both parties to be actively involved in the conversation. Synchronous communication mostly mirrors our mode of communicating in person, where you‚Äôre actively engaged in the conversation, but when you move that process to the digital medium, there‚Äôs a formality that is associated with the translations to the digital format that puts heavier pressure on each interaction. It‚Äôs why ‚Äúzoom fatigue‚Äù is universal and we‚Äôve started to hate our devices as we‚Äôve had to rely on them for social interaction.In this sort of world, our energy is constantly being drained, and it‚Äôs hard to just let out hair down. How can we cultivate more environments that feel safe and allow you to truly embrace your authentic self, while also preserving the magic of spontaneity that comes from a broad and open social platform?Dispowas one of the first to champion this in a grounded execution. It was able to tackle the problem of ‚Äúwhere do I post and what does it mean when I post in that context given who can see it?‚Äù by pushing the moment of share to a significant delay from when you take the photo (9am the next day) and moving the synchronous communication to an async ‚Äúadd to roll.‚ÄùfromWhy I Like DispobyNathan BaschezAnd even though the need for this will be lessened as life returns to normal, and people have outlets for in-person connection to escape from the zoom fatigue, we‚Äôll still do a large amount of interaction digitally, and for those interactions, we will still find greater ease expressing ourselves in lower-pressure contexts.Where else can we provide lower-pressure contexts? What other kinds of content would we like to share? What would this look like applied to latent ideas or interesting links or short thoughts?In the end, we want these lower pressure contexts because we want to put ourselves out there tofind our vibe tribe. The broadness of the internet allows us to interface with so many people we normally wouldn‚Äôt be able to interact with, and the only way to plug into that vast ocean of posts and avatars is to play the game and post ourselves. Lower pressure contexts are a kind of social environment that provides the psychological safety for us to put our authentic selves into the digital ether and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here world.‚ÄùAfter a week of my100 mini-essays, I got some feedback on the fatigue of reading a substantial piece every day and the potential loss of conveying the full idea because of this. I‚Äôm making an adjustment to try to keep my essays around 500 word to be more manageable and really focus on creating a stub to express the essence of an idea.This is the7thinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>9 - dancing through life</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/dancing-through-life</link>
      <description>I used to hate dancing with a visceral passion. If it was ever suggested, I‚Äôd say ‚Äúoh, I can‚Äôt dance.‚Äù It‚Äôs similar to when your parent‚Äôscomputer breaks and they say ‚Äúoh, I‚Äôm not a computer person.‚ÄùThere‚Äôs a visceral, bodily rejection to the idea of performing this action, of being associated with this kind of identity. Often, it‚Äôs not so much a rejection out of dislike more than a self-defense mechanism to avoid being conflated with a foreign entity. Dancing is definitivelynot mebecause it‚Äôs so far outside my comfort zone that it‚Äôs inconceivable. Following this line of logic, I think it was the fear of exposure that lay at the root of this triggered guardrail. Dancing is something so naturally intimate and expressive that it‚Äôs almost impossible to be performative during it. It‚Äôs easy when attendance is compulsive because you can still distance yourself from the identity, but volunteering for it in any case that you‚Äôre not physically forced to do it is an invitation to be ridiculed.a snapshot of what life was like at city danceGiven this background, it‚Äôs still a bit surprising to me how much I love dancing now. It‚Äôs one of my common stress relievers now where I escape problem rabbit holes by jumping out of my seat and transforming the open slice of carpet in my room into a polished dance floor in my mind. Throw in some airpods, put on some bops, and let the music take over my body. Pesky thoughts and screaming concerns lodged into my conscious mind become lubricated and turning loose fall down into the ocean of subconscious thought. Inhibitions fade into a dull whisper in the background. All I can feel is the energy of each moment, delivered through the combination of vibrating strings, synthetics, and voices coalescing into a concentrated atom of feeling. The burdens of the routine of everyday life have been replaced by a hive-mind single-focus blank state. An automatic mode of operation, where choice isn‚Äôt an option. My actions are merely derivative from the musical input, another kind of external device to channel the dynamic energy of sound waves into the dynamic movement of limbs.What changed that allowed me to truly enjoy dancing now? Part of it is definitely the fact that I‚Äôm doing it alone in my room whereas the context I was asked to dance in before were alwayshigh-pressure social settings, whether it was auditioning for the monkey role in our school rendition of theHorton Gives a Whomusical or trying to strike the sweet spot of aloof compulsion with jumping and bopping your hand up and down to the beat of Flo Rida at middle school dances. In those cases, the overwhelming social pressure was to conform. Dancing was generally conceived to be fine if you were good at it and heavily discouraged if not, so as middle school boys do, you find the minimum set that allows you to see a glimpse of the fun of dancing while conforming to a ‚Äúcool‚Äù version that doesn‚Äôt look like dancing‚Äîhence the strange ritual of bouncing in place. But being alone isn‚Äôt the only thing that‚Äôs different. Pre-covid, I was regularly attending hip hop classes atCity Dance, a routine that solidified after a short but intense period of experimentation including everything from dance to improv to Toastmasters.I think the core of being able to dance freely is being satisfied with who you are. Because dancing is giving your body over as the vehicle for music to flow, you have to be comfortable giving your body like that. The comfort with that action stems from the awareness that you are enough, that you body is capable of channeling whatever it channels for the music. It‚Äôs an understanding that you are worthy, that you are awhole-hearted person.The ability to be satisfied with who you are and act as a competent vehicle for energy to flow through is why dancing through life is so powerful. Originally, I heard this phrase fromThe Courage to be Disliked, a Japanese book in a dialogue style that goes through Adlerian psychology. Instead of constantly going from one goal to the next, stepping stones in a line to the top, under the traditional thinking around living a successful life, dancing through life means treating life as a series of moments, that you focus fully on, each one the most important thing while you live through it. Dancing through life means focusing on yourcraft not your career, intensely living in the current moment, and understanding that you are enough.How does this mindset allow you to adopt new identities? Doesn‚Äôt accepting that you‚Äôre enough mean you shouldn‚Äôt change? I think the difference comes from two different interpretations ofaccepting.One feels like a heavy weight, an inevitable yet unfinished conclusion‚Äîaccepting that youcan‚Äôtchange. The other feels like a light awareness, a base point which opens up access to any path‚Äîaccepting that you are enough because you can change if you take steps towards it.It‚Äôs this confidence that comes from detaching from your body and letting your body be the medium for expression for some idea combined with knowing that you‚Äôre enough. This acceptance gives you thepsychological oxygento try out a new identity, like trying on a new coat. You do a fit check and see how you vibe with it. Instead of, ‚Äúcan you pull off this look?‚Äù you‚Äôre thinking ‚Äúwhat is my take on this look?‚Äù You start to cultivate a wardrobe of different styles because you‚Äôre able to put yourself out there and look different or weird compared to the crowd.Anita ü•ë@Neats29Something I've learned from@visakanv, not based on something he's said but based on observing him,¬†is to reframe: "that's not for me" 
to: "what would my version look like?"

In the past I've dismissed things because I'm introverted, or I'm not good at X

But then I look at Visa8:14 AM ‚àô Feb 4, 2021230Likes11RetweetsDancing through life is embracing the raw, unfiltered nature of experiencing things in the moment, of following the energy as you go and accepting that you‚Äôre just along for the ride, to be a willing vehicle for energy to flow through, an organic vibe machine.This is the9thinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>10 - dampening of curiosity</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/dampening-of-curiosity</link>
      <description>Walking around SF, absorbing the sights and sounds and smells, I‚Äôm reminded of so many divergent branches of thought andexperience from my life now: the puff from a cigarette taking me to barely lit back alleys where businessmen take respite from their draining routines; the water lapping against the concrete transporting me to summer nights at the beach, the two-toned sensation of the warm fire in front and the cool darkness behind; the misty inlet in the distance bringing to mind the musky, cool air deep among the fauna, an expanse of unknown waiting to be explored.sunset at Ocean Beach pre-bonfire (more on myinstagram)The lack of these diverse experiences and sensory stimuli recently, both with COVID and focusing intensely on a recent project, has made me realize that I was deep in a state ofdampened curiosityup until recently. I originally heard about this concept fromThe Making of Prince of Persia:It got my mind offPoP[Prince of Persia] and onto new things. Made me realize how much I‚Äôvedamped my curiosityabout the world, these last few months, in the interest of efficiency. It‚Äôs time to start rekindling it‚Ä¶ looking for new people, places, friends. I shouldn‚Äôt just rush on to the next project with tunnel vision. I should relax, take a look around.This state comes about from the paradox of going deep into execution mode for a creative and highly mental taxing pursuit. It mirrors the tension between our‚Äúalways on‚Äùhyper-productive mentality and the newly vitalized movement to let yourselfbe unproductiveand ‚Äútake a look around.‚Äù The creative parts have mostly been figured out and you have to narrow your focus to produce, lest you wallow away in the land of endless idea generation. In order to bring something intensely creative into the world, it requires shutting your own mind off to the natural call of curiosity, the fuel for creativity.At first, this heightened state of focus is intensely energizing, especially coming from the breadth of boundless curiosity, the focus is relieving, like Rock Lee taking off his weights you feel like you‚Äôve powered up. In many ways, youarepowered up, narrowing your focus and bounding your curiosity frees up a lot of mental processes to execute in flow, converting ideas into flesh, matter, and bits.But there‚Äôs a hidden cost you incur over time staying here. The longer you stay, the more you start to feel comfortable in this mode of operation. Letting your creativity free suddenly seems scary, something you can‚Äôt believe you ever did before. You start to think it might be better to stay inside the walls after all, that the barriers are in place for your own good. Your comfort becomes a liability, your natural wonder smothered by plush, authentic down routines, cozy realms of expertise, and safe houses of social interaction.I never want to feel so comfortable that I feel scared to leave. I want to teeter in that grey, liminal space between the edge of my comfort and the known boundary of the unknown, a place of greater risk but also greater reward, where the opportunity for magic is abundant but your body is forced to adapt to the harsh conditions to reap the rewards. I want to push my body and my mind to the limits, to stretch the boundaries of my creative pursuit, the depth of my interpersonal intimacy, and the borders of my knowledge domain. I yearn for the freedom to press the frontier of what‚Äôs within the realm of possibility, to expand our collective understanding of what we can expect, to bring the sublime into the everyday.How can we bring these idealistic figments of imagination into tangible manifestations while maintaining our curious drive? We move back and forth between divergent idea generation and convergent idea curation, oscillating between a childlike fascination with everything and an adult-like laser-focus on breathing physical life into our ideas.¬†I guess the first step is the awareness of the mental state you inhabit and catching yourself before you get too comfortable, proactively giving your mind the space to breathe and wander a bit, even if you do have to return to the focused execution mode later.This is the10thinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>11 - realizing an idea</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/realizing-an-idea</link>
      <description>While talking to some friends the other day about the nature of coding software into existence, we drew the distinction between two forms of creating software: one where you plug into the existing pattern you see and trial-and-error your way to a solution and the other where you dive into each piece that‚Äôs already there and understand it for itsunderlying form, a term from Art of Zen and Motorocycle Maintenance which means the function it has rather than just the appearance. Beyond software, I think this mental model applies to all work that involves creating, bringing something to life that wasn‚Äôt there before.I‚Äôve started to think about these two modes of creation astriaging tasksvs.realizing an idea.The former entails the kind of work that you typically imagine for a standard project‚Äîpicking tasks off of a Trello board or JIRA epic or other endless backlog of issues in YATMA, and finding the right code pointer to see the shape of what you‚Äôre working with. Typically, there are already examples of the kind of thing that you need to do, and it‚Äôs a matter of copying + pasting an existing example and tweaking the levers, and adjusting the details until it fits what you need for it to do. There‚Äôs a lot of benefits to this approach, namely that it‚Äôs extremely efficient. There‚Äôs a low upper limit on how much context you need to gather before getting to a solution that works for you. It‚Äôs why Ruby on Rails was one of the most popular web development languages for so long with their principle of‚ÄúConvention over Configuration,‚Äù which pares down the number of decisions developers have to make by hiding ‚Äúthe cruft‚Äù for you. Because of this, it‚Äôs very easy to get started for simple tasks in a Rails codebase since there‚Äôs a lot of preformed templates and oiled processes for you to follow. Outside of software, it‚Äôs why the clickbait article format is so easy for people to get started with creating content with. There‚Äôs an understandable shape that is easy to plug and play. When things go wrong, it favors ashotgun debuggingapproach, a trial-and-error method of figuring out what‚Äôs wrong, because it‚Äôs a quick way to approximate where to look (also a symptom of our current debugging tools, where available, being heavy friction for users which makes usfeel that they are beyond understanding). The benefit is that you only need to take as much context as needed for the task at hand to maximize the time efficiency to completion. This explains why it‚Äôs so natural for an organization to slowly completely move to this mode of operation as it grows because it‚Äôs the most efficient for operating in the context of a large system, specialists over generalists. However, the downside is that this mode of operation makes it very difficult for you to do anything outside of the cordoned-off area of expertise that you‚Äôve developed. When things don‚Äôt fit the pattern at all, it becomes a problem because your typical thought branches start from the wrong basis.On the other hand, realizing an idea is approaching the problem at hand holistically, seeing the end idea that needs to be achieved, and working from every foundational piece to bring that vision to life. This mode of creating involves understanding the components of a system at a level of depth significantly beyond the surface and using that understanding to decide when to break the ‚Äúrules‚Äù of traditional operation. In software, this means going beyond copying the existing patterns in place by digging deeper into how and why those patterns were formed, following the rabbit hole to a point where thepurposeof the pattern is clear. In writing, it means taking pieces of genres that you like, removing the parts that aren‚Äôt, and playing with seemingly ridiculous mashups of ideas to craft a compelling world and story. The essence of this mindset is divining the purpose of different components of a creation because the purpose determines what the component does well and poorly. With this understanding, you‚Äôre able to mix and match to find a custom solution that fits the core problem of the idea you want to realize. This kind of thinking is essential to true innovation and creativity in terms of introducing entirely new paradigms into the world. Cryptocurrency is an example of digging deep into the foundational aspects of a modern-day economy, taking the pieces of computer science like cryptography to form unbreakable contracts and taking the pieces of economics to create a scarce resource.It‚Äôs easy for us to fall into thetriaging tasksmode by default, especially given our societal focus around the prestige of achieving quantifiable goal posts and the obsession around productivity porn. And while it is great for moving quickly and executing on items within a certain pattern and scope, you end up having to pay the cost long-term when things don‚Äôt fit the pattern that‚Äôs been engrained into your mind. Therealizing an ideamode of creation is essential to bringing entirely new creations and ways of thinking into the world. Training to default to this mindset, especially when diving into a new space or system where there are a lot of moving parts that don‚Äôt require understanding, is key to setting up the proper foundation to build on. It requires a departure from the norm of getting things done fast and having reaching the milestone be the end-all-be-all of your work, but it‚Äôs worth the early investment. When you‚Äôre starting out and the stakes are low is the perfect time to invest in picking away at that dense fog of unknown surrounding these components, and if you keep at it, one day you might be surprised at how solid your understanding of the entire flow has become.As I‚Äôm coming to a completion, perhaps this is just a more anchored reframing of the modes of thinking I explored in mylast pieceas it parallels a lot of the same contrasts I made there, so if you haven‚Äôt read that, it might be worth a skim.This is the11thinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>12 - slow burn</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/slow-burn</link>
      <description>I finally finishedNever Let Me Goby Kazuo Ishiguro the other day. If you haven‚Äôt heard of it, it‚Äôs a novel about an alternate reality set in England where you follow the personal reflections of Kathy, recalling her life, where she grew up in a boarding school. The following won‚Äôt spoil what happens in the book but will talk about some of the mechanics that lead up to the main conflict, so if you want to read it at some point and avoid diving in, feel free to skip this edition.The book starts you off with a feeling of unease, but something that you can‚Äôt quite place your finger on. Kathy is writing in the present day as a carer and talking about the ones she cared for who didn‚Äôt make it. Abruptly we shift to her childhood memories of growing up in an elite boarding school where the children are required to produce art and cultivate other creative pursuits as their only work. This cultivates a social dynamic where the children who are more creative are more popular and known. With a fake money system from the school, their only possessions are these creative works that they buy from their classmates (along with items from a sale of second-hand miscellaneous goods brought in from the outside). As we follow Kathy‚Äôs innocent, winding, innocuous recollections of her time at the boarding school, highlighting the dramas that mattered to her at that time, this sense of unease runs as a constant undercurrent in our minds. Perhaps we start to wonder about their parents and why they‚Äôre confined to the school. We start to wonder about the ‚Äúguardians‚Äù and what their roles are. We start to wonder what happens on ‚Äúgraduation‚Äù and why the art is so crucial. Because it‚Äôs told from the perspective of a teenage girl, some of the bits can feel dry as she recalls the tribulations of everyday life, but this undercurrent of dread and confusion keeps us going.I‚Äôm reminded ofBurning, the film adaption of a Murakami novel by Lee Chang-dong. If you haven‚Äôt seen it, I won‚Äôt spoil it for you, but suffice it to say that the movie follows its namesake by stoking this slow undercurrent burn of unease that explodes to a peak towards the end.Never Let Me Godoesn‚Äôt have quite as dramatic of an explosive moment where everything comes to culmination like that, but as you slowly uncover the clues and bits of truth, you start to follow just to see how Kathy‚Äôs opinion and worldview will change. As you discover the true purpose of the children, you‚Äôre caught between focusing on the relationships with Kathy and Tommy and Ruth and the systems at play that have cultivated this kind of world. Perhaps that‚Äôs one of the most central dynamics of the book, to demonstrate their innate humanness through this focus on their relationship all the while showing that they live in a world where they are less than human to everyone else.The slow burn is us trying to escape the fantastical worlds where good defiantly triumphs over evil or the world is doomed. Instead, we slowly come to terms with the fact that evilness is a slow, boring, natural process of entropy. We grow to intimately identify with Kath‚Äôs growing resignation towards the matter and become frustrated on her behalf. We try to thrash against the natural order, but of course, as readers, we are powerless to stop things from going to their pre-determined end. Perhaps the feeling we encounter throughout the book that gives us the most rage is the pity. The ‚Äúyou poor things‚Äù (literally because they are not considered humans) attitude reeks of the elitist ‚Äúyou only got so far because we gave you the opportunity to‚Äù persona, and we instinctively lash out in defense of our innocent narrator. The lesson seems to be to make a difference while we can, to fight to bring goodness into the world in our every day, to rage against the dying of the light even when it seems inconvenient or pointless, because we‚Äôll be thankful we did if it ever comes to rest for good.This is the12thinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>14 - finding texture</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/finding-texture</link>
      <description>A story that compels you to continue turning the pages, the idea you read on a deep twitter thread that your mind keeps turning back to during showers, the art piece that is forever burned in your mind. The common thread between all of these things is how they make you want to see the world from the perspective of the creator. There‚Äôs a new, undiscovered feeling that the idea evokes when you play around it with your mind. Running your mental fingers along the ridges and the curves, you‚Äôre intrigued by the roughshapeof the thing, and the resonance you feel from the surface compels you to explore all the layers. This is thetextureof the creation, the property that combines uniqueness with an impactful first impression, where you‚Äôre left wanting to understand more of the world that this creation inhabits.a rock formation in Zion National Park (morehere)Texture is the tangible, 3d personality that pops out of the medium for a piece of media or out of the abstract for a thought that allows ideas to penetrate your everyday perception. Texture is the product of the idea developing on its own, when the human creator has become a mere passenger along for the ride. It's what gets created when the creative flame roars beyond control and burns away the trivial, leaving behind the most essential, a unique, unrepeatable mark that acts as an undeniable identity card for the original idea.visa is almost done ‚úçüèæüìñ@visakanvChappelle and Seinfeld on letting the idea drive, and ‚Äúthe guy onstage‚Äù1:57 PM ‚àô Jul 29, 201952Likes4RetweetsNotably, this is a very different mindset from our traditional model of ownership over ideas. It‚Äôs the constant tension between wanting tobesomeone who creates something cool and wanting to create something cool for its own sake. Everything we do is colored by our status-oriented society, and it‚Äôs a constant struggle to fight against that default tendency and get your ego out of the way. When we‚Äôre driven by the desire for ownership rather than the desire for creation, it taints the creation with an underlying desire for power rather than letting the creation speak for itself.visa is almost done ‚úçüèæüìñ@visakanvOne of the most tragic human traits is the desire for ownership. The impulse to pick flowers and cage birds - we think we love something, and we annihilate or imprison it in the process of making it ‚Äúours‚Äù. This jealous, destructive possessiveness is still celebrated as romantic3:51 AM ‚àô Jul 21, 2018107Likes22RetweetsThe mark that texture leaves islike a name. Something that automatically designateswhatand hints at the why. This texture is the sensation our minds encounter when they play with ideas made this way. Something about it is a sharp break from the overwhelming amount of content that is produced and then shoved down our information pipelines to our brains. The steady stream of breaking news, the manicured status updates of social media, and the back and forth of opposing intellectual opinion pieces. They provide us value but in a way that leaves us drained of energy, every day the same package with a slightly different set of contents.Feeling texture is our mind's instinct telling us that something is interesting‚Äîthat it feels new or different from the standard format we're inundated in all day. We're taught to bestandard from our standardized educationand to communicate in a standard way about standard topics for efficiency's sake. The academic world is separated into clean disciplines: computer science in one place and humanities in another and biology in the another one. Preciseness and streamlined are the names of the game. And it's how we end up with vastly similar and smooth textures in the world. Our information palate has gotten used to the silky smoothness of delivery which is why it's so taken aback by heavily textured works.This pressure to conform towards smoothness cascades from our ideas down to our very identities. Society wants to produce standardized citizens for operational efficiency and civic order, which is why we‚Äôre encouraged to stamp out weird behaviors early on and behave like upstanding examples of the right way of doing things, the traditionally accepted path for new adults in the world. It‚Äôs so striking when you encounter someone who is unabashedly authentic to themselves, to the point that they not just unique but ‚Äúweird,‚Äù precisely because it‚Äôs so rare in a world where you‚Äôre pressured to do the opposite. People who are able to inhabit this way of living constantly are free, and the ones that give us the most pause aredifferently free,free but in a way very different from ours.Texture indicates unbridled expression. An expression of a core feeling from deep within an idea or someone's id. All of us are really just searching for texture, jumping from one especially resonant texture to the next when we're following what our heart wants to do. Life is a long journey of evolving our texture, finding the resonant textures in the people and ideas around us, and discovering how we can channel our identity into the broader world through creations.I want to be constantly free, embracing the unique texture I‚Äôve cultivated authentically. To channel the ideas that feel too crazy to be realistic, too weird to be normal, too imaginary to be real‚Äîthe ideas that most yearn to break free, to roar to life in a creative flame and yank the driver's seat away from you. I want to let go of my desire for ownership, to focus on being the tool to expressing the creation‚Äôs essence and simply enjoy the ride when the idea takes over. And ultimately, I want to find and connect intimately with the different textures of the world, ideas that challenge my notion of what‚Äôs ‚Äúright‚Äù and people that expand my concept of what‚Äôs possible.This is the14thinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>15 - making shit</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/making-sht</link>
      <description>In theArt of Zen and Motorcycle Maintenance,the author brings up the concept ofqualityand how he pondered the question of what it actually is while a professor of philosophy at university. It‚Äôs a chicken-and-egg problem‚Äîquality is always relative and derived from our internal notion of quality for other things, which depends on our societal notions of quality in different communities. Can you even approach deriving a definition for quality in the absence of all of that, abstracted to the extreme? The author struggles with this question and more specifically, struggles to come up with an answer to it when teaching his students: how does he know what he‚Äôs saying is right? Is he just coming up with stuff to make it look like he knows what he‚Äôs talking about?The core issue is thatqualityis not something we can be taught in the same way that we can be taught the grammar rules of a language or that the ‚Äúmitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.‚Äù It isn‚Äôt just a composition of facts and rules, a set of if-this-then-thats. It‚Äôs something deeper and more complex and closer tofeelingand art than science. Instead of teaching it directly as you would normally do with facts, the only thing you can do to support someone‚Äôs journey to quality is setting up the proper environment for discovering it themselves. It‚Äôs a big mindset shift from telling people the right steps to follow to nudging them to go in the right direction.The unavoidable step in truly understanding this concept ofqualityis justmaking shit.an example of some shit i made for a class in collegewhere it generated roast/compliment letters to raise money during February.Only throughdoingthings andmakingthings, do you start to understand what works and what doesn‚Äôt. Through the closeness between mind and material in the act of creation, you come to intimately know the skill and the subtleties of the craft. This sort of thing simply can‚Äôt be learned throughshowing.You can show what‚Äôs good through examples of things that work and you can show how to make that thing, but that doesn‚Äôt translate into the sort of magic needed to create generically good things in any context.So much of getting good at anything is just pure labor: figuring outhowto try and then offering up the hours. If you‚Äôre doing it wrong you can do it a thousand times and not produce any particularly interesting results. So you have to make sure you‚Äôre trying the right way.‚Äîhttps://ava.substack.com/p/effortThis is why trite advice like ‚Äújust do it‚Äù and ‚Äúpractice makes perfect‚Äù are so resonant (and effective if you‚Äôre stopping yourself from making). Making bad shit and mediocre shit and dumb shit and shit shit and everything in between is the key to unlocking what components could be in good shit. Sure outlines and principles and methods are useful mental models to approach that, but they are useless in the abstract when detached from the reality of making stuff and seeing which parts stick.In any craft, you can learn the nouns and the verbs (the objects and the mechanics that manipulate them), but they‚Äôre meaningless without some end purpose tying them together. The fundamentals are useless without a direction to point them in and a story to tell about them. We‚Äôre all chasing after the stories that our shit brings to life. Our craft is a series of accumulating stories, tales of our triumphs and frustrations and despairs and joys, all the messy middle involved in bringing something from our minds into the world.Some remaining questions/thoughts on my mind:How do we encourage people to make shit? It has to be fun, it has to encourage, and people need to come with a genuine sense of curiosityHow do weoptimize for fun and playfulnessto encourage this?

      <title>16 - remixing</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/remixing</link>
      <description>I‚Äôve been pretty obsessed with the idea of ‚Äúremixing‚Äù lately. I had mentioned the term briefly in mylast essay, but it deserves a lot more excavation to get at the essence of the idea.I‚Äôm not sure where I first encountered this idea. According to my Roam, the first mention of the word is from early December in reference to a hackathon idea to enable easier remixing of pieces of Coda. However, the word must have started to surface on Twitter some time before that. Over time, whether it has actually risen in usage or I‚Äôve just noticed / interacted with the usage more, I‚Äôve seen a steady increase in the popularization of this term, especially in reference to creative work.FromWikipedia:Aremixis a piece of media which has been altered or contorted from its original state by adding, removing, and changing pieces of the item. A song, piece of artwork, books, video, poem, or photograph can all be remixes. The only characteristic of a remix is that it appropriates and changes other materials to create something new.Originating from when recorded sound was invented and music became a common-place household item, listeners had the ability to rearrange their listening experience (although it was much harder back then). Over the years, remixing became easier and easier from cutting andscratchingrecords, used to introduce extra beats, to DJ software that allows fine-grained manipulation of sounds and even the introduction of synthetic sounds. This started off in music but has gradually pervaded to other creative works like show parodies, fan fiction, wiki-like communities, and open-source software.Remix culture, a culture that embraces the spirit of remixing, was just an idea that intellectuals talked about before, and now it‚Äôs steadily pervaded into all aspects of society and is becoming a staple of mainstream culture. In the software world, companies formed around open-source projects and products released under open-source licenses are becoming more and more common, with MongoDb, HashiCorp, Docker, along with newcomers like Brave and Apollo. Most recently in pop culture, Tik Tok championed this with their concept ofDuets, which allows users to ‚Äúbuild off‚Äù an existing video by overlaying their own side-by-side with the original. This is an interesting, new take on remix culture that enablesvibe remixing, where you take a vibe, created from a piece of content, and put your own spin on it.There has always been an inherent tension between remix culture and the capitalist, hyper-success culture that pervades our society. We‚Äôre taught to aim for the top, settle for nothing less, and to become ruthless is getting what we want if we want to win the zero-sum games to climb the corporate ladder. This mindset is amplified by our focus on individual success. We want to become like Bill Gates or Barack Obama, not contribute to advancing software or work on keeping our government running. In our culture, the appearance of success is more important than the actual contribution we commit. And if we want to become like Bill Gates, we need to come up with a groundbreaking, original, and exciting idea and make it ours, locked away behind several patents and thick layers of U.S. copyright law.[1] We love the idea of original ideas, but the truth is no idea is truly original. All ideas are derivative from what we‚Äôve seen and used and felt.In this sort of environment, how do we create an economical incentive for people to be open and embrace a remix culture? In the companies that have been founded on open source foundations, there‚Äôs a now-standard playbook for creating a profitable business under this path: leverage the open-source community for contributions while offering premium services, security, and ease of access as revenue drivers.Remixing andcommunityare closely tied together. How do we meld these two seamlessly to enable communities of creators who are encouraged to riff off each others‚Äô ideas to bring a hazy vision to life? I don‚Äôt have time to dig into this now but might explore in a future essay.Even though there are companies built on this open source foundation, our current software overwhelmingly offers very limited capabilities for remixing. In most software, you‚Äôre typically able to specify some set of preferences around the look of the app and the data that you want to find. You might see this manifest in a dark mode, custom avatars, pinning, rearranging, or saving content on the side of visual andfeel-likecustomizations. On the data side, you might see tags and filters and sorts, maybe even a search that combines those together. However, in the end, there‚Äôs an external person deciding the experience for you and dictating how you‚Äôre able to interact with the app and what levers you have access to manipulate. Someone else is controlling your capability to act and create. In contrast, in creation tools, a primary principle is prioritizing the users‚Äô capabilities and content, and the challenge in designing and crafting the platform is to provide the most basic, flexible, composable building blocks to allow user creativity to flourish. But what if this wasn‚Äôt just limited to the few creation tools we have?Is there a future where everything becomes remixable? A world where the software we consume everyday is also available for us to change at will to fit our needs? Where our products are malleable pieces of software which we can peek at the circuitry orshape to our preferences?It‚Äôs not clear that‚Äôs the future we‚Äôre headed in given the current landscape, but I‚Äôm hopeful for where else we can provide remixing as a first class capability in the tools that we use, whether digital or physical.I was inspired to write about this because I recently helped launch Custom Templates for Coda, our first class capability for remixing Coda content and sharing it with your team and broader community. If you‚Äôre interested in what that involved, you can read thefull details here. It covers the thinking that went behind the feature as well as the technical details involved in bringing it to life.‚Äî[1]: ¬†It‚Äôs interesting that China doesn‚Äôt have any of these things but still has huge companies.This is the16thinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>17 - beauty</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/beauty</link>
      <description>I took theAdobe Creative Typequiz the other day and was surprised to find that I tested as an Artist. They do qualify that you‚Äôre probably all the types and may even change types depending on your stage of life or what projects you‚Äôre taking on right now, but I‚Äôve never thought about myself as an artist for so many inane reasons, like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not an art guy‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have the background to understand art,‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôll cut into the time I need for useful skills like math.‚Äùthe full breakdown of ‚Äúthe artist‚ÄùIt‚Äôs fitting that the tagline for the artist ‚ÄúSeeing beauty, creating beauty‚Äù coincides with the title of what I named my newsletter ‚ÄúBridging Paradoxes and Discovering Beauty.‚Äù I‚Äôve come a long way from feeling that beauty is beyond my domain to actively seeking it out in everything I do. The traditional kind of beauty I thought about as a kid only existed in the passion of Delacroix , the preciseness of Michelangelo, or the disquiet of Munch. I didn‚Äôt realize that beauty was everywhere, disguised in different forms. When I became fascinated by things that didn‚Äôt follow that traditional definition, I was struck by the same sense of wonder and awe that I got when looking at art. I started to realize that beauty was all around, in combining chemicals into an entirely new substance; in building fake worlds, swaths of neighborhoods at a time, through a string of words; and even in ascertaining the truth to an unsolvable riddle from the composition of a few simple facts. I found that beauty is also a cool, cloudless, summer night, theinfinite layers of the night sky dazzling brightly, and a quiet forest with wisps of mist streaming between the slumbering trunks, and also a heavy breeze carrying a single orange leaf away from the changing trees.a falling leaf from the Pixar movie SoulBeauty can be found in everything as long as you know to look and you look to appreciate. How do we embrace that mindset of gratitude for the beauty around us rather than pining for the perfect beauty we are taught to grasp for? Some substances, like psychedelics, change your mental pathways to appreciate more of the beauty in everyday life. People say that they never look at trees the same way again, appreciating them for their complex beauty underlying the surface. Are there other ways to encourage this mindset towards every moment, to be grateful for the little things in life?Life becomes so much easier when you can be grateful for the small things that give you joy: a good latte, or just a slightly more palatable one if you‚Äôve been failing to make your own, an effortless conversation, a bright day after a week of thick clouds and fierce wind, the light draining from the horizon reflecting against a city skyline.Although beauty can be found everywhere, there‚Äôs a palpable difference between the sort of timeless, simple beauty of something known and the vibrant, shocking beauty of the unknown. While the former is everywhere, the latter is more commonly found in the seams between things, the joints where you go to combine and compose andremix. This kind of beauty is heavily connected to novelty‚Äîwe find manifestations of new ideas to be beautiful, skillful renditions of the same old to be mediocre. Raw skill isn‚Äôt key to this beauty; rather, the key is finding the magical mix of skill and imagination, with a dash of insanity.Direct demonstrations of skill start to beautify once you start to put different things together, to experiment with whatcould berather than whatshould be. It‚Äôs like when you learn the mechanics and rules of any skill: how to draw straight lines and create planes and introduce shadows in drawing or using conditional logic and manipulating the DOM and operating on data in programming. These basic rules tell you what‚Äôs possible and set the environment that you get to play in. Once you understand those basic skills, you can keep sharpening those areas, gettingreallygood at making intricate shadows orreallygood at DOM wizardry, but they don‚Äôt mean anything in isolation. It‚Äôs taking those deep skills that call out to you and combining them with other areas, whether in the same domain or not that renders something that others can identify with.Some people create for practical purposes: they find an idea that is profitable and feasible and work to make it happen. Others build for aesthetic reasons: they have a vision that they can‚Äôt get out of their mind to the point that they need to bring it to life, regardless of how outlandish it seems. Building for aesthetics allows you to pursue an idea purely out of a desire to make it a reality, which empowers you to go past traditional guardrails of practicality and efficiency and enter dreamland. This is great for exploring a crazy idea because it stretches your mind for what options to even consider. The downside is that you might make something that is entirely detached from how real society and real people operate, an idea that is too abstract or crazy for anyone to relate to. The trick is to walk the fine line between the two modes of operation, following your instinct for beauty while connecting it back to everyday reality. As a creator of beauty, you have to cycle between dreaming and listening to build the bridge between the tangible and the fantastical, charting the path from our current world to a new, imagined world.I love the freedom that comes from creative expression, how you‚Äôre able to take a blob of an idea, a thing without substance, and bring it into the world, mental fluff made into solid matter, is real-world magic to me. I feel the most alive when I‚Äôm working on bringing an idea to life, to actualize the metaphor that reverbs through the chambers of my head.This is the17thinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>19 - the silo culture</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/the-solo-culture</link>
      <description>I happened across and finished this incomplete post from maybe a few months ago, thinking it was a different piece that I was recently working on. Usually, I lose the energy to finish a piece if it‚Äôs been a while since I worked on it, but for some reason, I was able to easily pick this one up again from the rough outline/word vomit that I had left at the end, and it was also interesting to ‚Äúinhabit‚Äù an old frame of mind. I wonder if anyone intentionally leaves the frame of mind you inhabit in a particular essay to come back to it with a fresh perspective many weeks later.I was biking around San Francisco this morning and had a renewed sense of awareness of the vast diversity of neighborhoods and populations that we have here. TheWestworld-like, ultra-modernglass plazas of Dogpatch and Mission Bay, the grungy streets and loud taquerias of the Mission, the rush of grandmas and overflowing supermarkets in Chinatown, the post-college slightly more upscale college park hangouts of North Beach, and the list goes on. Each neighborhood has its own vibe and a core population that defines and embodies that vibe. Yet despite the presence of so many different distinct groups, they rarely overlap, and even when they do, it‚Äôs done so in inter-group bubbles and through scripted interactions (think tech bros getting their favorite burritos from the mission post-clubbing).Mission District vs. Financial District in San FranciscoAcross groups, we don‚Äôt talk to each other, and even when we do, it‚Äôs framed around something transactional„Éºan exchange of goods not of people or their stories. These interactions are easy and safe because no one has to change their default behavior. We live in silos of connection and relationship. We talk to the same people who we go to school with, work with, and mingle with. Social stigma stops us from going outside of these designated zones lest we be shamed for breaking the norm. Certain social groups are not supposed to mix because that‚Äôs just how it is. Just like there are certain bars for education for who can be a partner, there are certain bars for who can be a friend, a standard for who you‚Äôre allowed to care about.Even if you don‚Äôt hold this belief, it can be incredibly hard to meet and really get to know people from different spheres because our spaces weren‚Äôt designed for this kind of interaction. The default behavior that our public areas encourage is for people to mingle within their circles, with structures (both informal like language and formal like patrolling security) to enforce that division. Because we don‚Äôt interact with other groups, we don‚Äôt understand their struggles, needs, and hopes. We only think about us and our tribe when we go to the voting booth, when we launch products, and when we write policy. And once the problems start, the opportunity for productive discourse has long past while the time for finger pointing and blame fights flourishes. Our defaults are all wrong for encouraging a connected and empathetic society, one that can work through hard problems in a healthy and unified manner.Intimacy happens from proximity*, so how can we modify our default spaces to better encouragelow-pressure, informal cross-pollination between different groups? What makes a good environment for cross-pollination?Modern life is about being individually empowered and free and entrepreneurs and self-empowering and confident and self-love. This is great for a self-confidence boost, but the focus is all on the self, which engenders a culture of individualism where we feel like we shouldn‚Äôt ask anyone for help. We can do everything ourselves, so we should do everything ourselves to prove it to the world. This rise coincides with the rising feelings of isolation and depression because our individual focus causes us to constantly compare with others. How can we love ourselves without taking note from all our idols and our peers that post the very best images of themselves in every crevice of our digital experiences? It‚Äôs ironic that the image of the century is one of entrepreneurship and self-love, yet we still derive validation from what other peoplesayabout our take on taking charge of life and loving yourself. We are after theaestheticof self-empowerment and self-love to derive love from our community, instead of the substance of that empowerment that allows us to transcend this need for external validation.A description ofJane Jacob‚Äôs ideal city design, free of cars:People would get off the train and walk, and walking (without fear of traffic death) would change the urban landscape, away from the shopping plaza, the parking lot, the gas station, and the roadside sign to townhouses, caf√©s, bookstores, the kind of places that encouraged pedestrians to linger, and their presence would spur other businesses to cluster, and before long there would be density‚ÄîJane Jacobs‚Äôs heaven. Strangers would meet in nontraumatic accidental encounters and exchange ideas.The Unwinding by George PackerHow can humans enable interoperability and promote a culture of healthy self-empowerment, the ability to know that you are enough the way you areandwant to participate in and contribute to a community?The idea of interoperability and silos is so fascinating as I‚Äôve started to see trails of it everywhere now. The silos of community that we‚Äôve formed in our cities, divided along racial and socio-economic and political lines. The corporate data silos that our manufactured digital content are held hostage in, with few common formats to rely on and fewer incentives to create high-fidelity export options. The mini supercomputer silos of our personal computing devices, a gateway to a personalized and completely unique digital world, which masquerades asthe real world. Whether by design or by chance, there are silos trapping us everywhere, but the lines of the limits are invisible until you start looking for it intentionally. How might we break down the silos to allow for more interoperability and cross-pollination of ideas, perspectives, and media in a way that is healthy (sustainable long-term for human cross-pollination and secure for data cross-pollination)?This is the19thinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <description>partly inspired by this message that Ameesh sent me today.spencer chang (19/100 mini üìù)@spencerc99look dumb11:29 PM ‚àô Jun 3, 2021There‚Äôs a lot of trite advice I give myself, but today was especially rich in the amount of things I was telling myself not to forget. A bunch of them were things that I marked down as candidates for full-featured mini-essays, so here‚Äôs a bullet list of them for your perusal. Would love to hear in the comments if any in specific particularly make you curious or want to hear more about in a dedicated mini-essay.all of the stuff in the screenshot above that i typedplayinfinite gamesweirdness is a proxy for being true to yourself. The more weird you can be in front of people, the more comfortable you are with being authentic (have a stub of an essay on this)don‚Äôt take anything personally. take tough, honest advice as the view of ‚Äúthe critic‚Äù and use it to inform how you would convince themdont compromise on what you want if you know what you wantto do ^, know deeply what you want,develop your personal tasteangst is necessary to be willing to advocate for dramatic changeangst without community or optimism leads you to nihilismoptimism + angst leads you to optimistic nihilism, which gets you to actually engage with society and take practical steps towards making things betteris the key to optimism your community? giving you a reason to be optimistic about thingsjolt yourself out of being stuckwhen people dont vibe with an idea, it could have nothing to do with the idea and everything to do with the presentation of the ideatypical indicators of ‚Äúquality‚Äù are inaccurate (YoE could mean great or many years of being bad)follow the awesome, the energy, the creative flame, the path of least resistance, of most accelerationthe ‚Äúyou know it when you see it‚Äù feeling is very powerful agent for knowing what has chemistry with you and what doesn‚Äôtbe grateful and give backbe greedier (along the lines ofgambling)imagine a future where i‚Äôve surpassed my limitsOkay so this spiraled into both advice to myself and some open-ended questions on my mind.

      <title>21 - aperture of life</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/aperture-of-life</link>
      <description>Today started off as a pretty shitty day. I haven‚Äôt been this thrown off from my baseline in a while. I woke up to find out that our apartment storage unit had been broken into and my new road bike stolen :/ (side note is that it seems like i‚Äôm unfortunately making an annual habit of getting money scammed/stolen from me..?)In photography, aperture is the description of how open the lens of the camera is. The larger the aperture, the more light the camera takes in and vice versa.In life, we constantly adjust our aperture depending on how we‚Äôre feeling and where we are. We oscillate between a small aperture, obsessing over one event that made us upset, and a large one, contemplating the entire meaning of our very existence. When things shake us significantly out of our baseline state of happiness (either positively or negatively), it‚Äôs easy to narrow in to focus just on that event. In the case of a bad event (say a bike getting stolen), it‚Äôs natural to want to obsess over it, to rage against the unfairness of the world or break down all the things you could‚Äôve done differently to prevent it. When something good happens, you might expect that youshouldobsess over it and fully enjoy it, butobsessingover it is very different from being fully present to enjoy it. If you close your focus to just the event, it‚Äôs easy to start to compare everything in your life to this perfect moment, to constantly be disappointed by the imperfections and bumps of daily life. You‚Äôll find an urge to try to optimize all parts of life for this level of happiness, to extinguish any potential for disappointment or failure or rejection.Both mindsets taken to the extreme lead to a scarcity mindset towards the world and ultimately disconnecting from the world and its surrounding community. Whether you are raging against all the things in the world that you can‚Äôt control or shielding yourself from all the bad things in the world that you can‚Äôt account for, both attitudes are one of nonacceptance of reality and of the nature of life itself.The solution is to broaden the aperture of life. I originally heard about this concept from Dustin Yellin, an amazing, mind-bending artist, in hisinterview on the Tim Ferris Show, where he talks about his methods to increase the aperture of life. He describes increasing aperture in life as crucial to how he finds continual inspiration for his work. By taking in more of life and the surrounding, you start to see all the infinite detail that life contains (from the patterns on a leaf, to the layout of cities, to the sensation of a breeze on your body). When you widen your aperture to take in all ofthis texture, how can you be caught up in a bad event or the perfection of a memory? In the face of such infinite beauty and definition all around you, it feels silly to inhabit a mindset of scarcity. Yellin talks about some ways he‚Äôs utilized to widen his aperture, including psychedelics, meditation, nature, and people).One thing Inever learnis that I need to widen my aperture when I get stuck on something narrow. My natural instinct is to push through the mud, toinvest effortuntil the wall in front of me bends to my will, when a lot of the time I just need some time away from the narrow frame to re-orient my focus. When I catch myself obsessing over a bad outcome or daydreaming over a more perfect situation, I need to reset the camera and remember the incomprehensible amount of things in the present that I have to be grateful for and to enjoy in the now.I think pessimists often have a very narrow aperture. They focus on the specific things that could go wrong and convert that judgment into a judgment of the whole, rather than absorbing the world that the idea presents. I prefer a life of abundance over one of scarcity. One ofinfinite gamesrather than finite, zero-sum ones. And one of runs outside along the waterfront, soaking in the warm sun and the frigid wind, the ambient chatter and the screaming cars, one of embracing the pleasant and the not so pleasant rather than one of sitting inside brooding over my lost bike and the memories it entails.To widening my aperture and appreciating ever more of life‚Äôs infinite beauty and intricacy.a view I was appreciative of during my afternoon run along Embarcadero.This is the21stinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>22 - reflection systems</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/reflection-systems</link>
      <description>The other day someone in a Facebook group I‚Äôm a part of wrote a question asking about people‚Äôs methods for reflection. I‚Äôve always been a reflective person, but it wasn‚Äôt until a couple years ago that I started being more meticulous around recording my thoughts and keeping them all in one place.Ever since spring of 2019, I started doing a daily journal in order to keep snapshots of my mental state over time. I like that daily journaling gives me a ritual that forces me to dump the chaotic swirl of emotions and instincts and thoughts from my mind into a comprehensive form. I also track habits that I‚Äôm trying to build, so there‚Äôs a built-in accountability system with my journal, when I‚Äôm talking about my highlights / lowlights of the day. It‚Äôs all available as atemplate, if you‚Äôre interested in trying it out! Here‚Äôs an example of the kind of reflection I‚Äôm able to make using the data.spencer chang (21/100 mini üìù)@spencerc99reviewing a year of this because feeling a bit nostalgicspencer chang (21/100 mini üìù)@spencerc99I made a post on how and why I journal with a fun experiment of a live monitor of how I'm doing that's automatically updated with my data each day. 

üëâ https://t.co/PqR0xVzyz0
üôè @nikhilthota @jlfwong for feedback
&amp; thanks to @jborichevskiy + @lehrjulian for inspiration2:23 AM ‚àô Jan 20, 2021Having this space to gather the data and dump my inner mess into something with more structure also enables me to do fun stuff like share select pieces of that with the broader Internet. I make the aggregate quantitative data about my days and my habits available on myLive Spencer Monitor.a snapshot of my Live MonitorThis sort of mirrors that big trend where apps would offer to post your goals to your social media accounts to generate the social pressure to follow through, except it‚Äôs less pressure and more fun since it‚Äôs just making it always available on my website which people aren‚Äôt naturally checking every day (as far as I know). There‚Äôs a feeling of intimacy embedded in the fact that this view is always changing‚Äîthe configuration as it exists is a fleeting snapshot of my life that will shift within a day. Despite how abstracted this is from raw thoughts, it stillfeelspretty intimate because you can sort of derive my inner state from these numbers and charts. They‚Äôre high-level hints at the rich underlying context and detail involved in my day-to-day life. This is mostly all hypothesis given that I know the deeper context underlying the numbers, so I‚Äôm curious whether it gives off that vibe for those of y‚Äôall that have seen it.The last piece of my process is scheduling time to do deeper thought dumps quarterly. For my quarterly reflections, I usually just set aside 15-20 mins to brain dump everything that‚Äôs weighing on me and following the energy of my thoughts and emotions. After I feel like I‚Äôve gotten everything out, I go through my reflection and try to draw broad themes, highlighting pieces that stand out to me. To conclude, I try to organize these into buckets around personal/work/social that I want to continue, stop, and start doing, setting intentions for how my attitude should adapt moving forward.For the annual ones, I use a nifty template from Year Compass to do anannual reflection. I tend to avoid explicit, quantitatively-driven goals and instead, focus on broad themes to orient the new year around. In this way, I‚Äôm able to keep a high-level intention in mind in my day-to-day choices rather than getting bogged down evaluating the details of every path I see.Do you do any sort of reflection, and if so, what and how do you feel about it? Let me know if you try / check out any of these systems too! Curious to hear thoughts and reactions.Anyways this reflection bent got me thinking about my quarterly reflection and how I haven‚Äôt done one in a while, and I wanted to share my conclusions for this quarter:personal: continue on the path of authenticity, embrace it and find people who vibe with you. trust yourinstinct for energy and chase it. Put up foundations that you can build off in areas that you know you have energy incareer/craft: follow your heart in terms of what you want and continue sharpening that precise sense of the ideal style of working and area that you‚Äôre passionate about. Stretch yourself and embrace ambiguity and ownership of new areas. Trust yourself to handle it wellsocial: intentionally spend more time with peoplewho give you energyand who you admire, be comfortable saying no to the people that you dont admire or have opposing world views. be more intentional about regularly diving deep with people close to you and getting to know new people who you think you would vibe with. Break through hesitation to send messages when you think of them.Eliminate the filter when it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs preventing you from doing something that has no downside / only has positive potential outcomes (which is most things you filter)</description>

      <title>23 - trust</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/trust</link>
      <description>The lowest points in my life has always been when I haven‚Äôt felt a base of trust and have felt powerless to do change my situation as a result. Trust‚Äîthe feeling of safety and belonging provides the foundation for anything you want to accomplish. I‚Äôm writing this and feeling like it sounds incredibly simple as I think of Maslow‚Äôs Hierarchy of Needs but it feels like every need in the middle boils down to trust: you need to feel physically safe in your location, you need to feel safe in the context of a community, and you need to feel safe in the context of yourself. All aspects of this safety rely on trust‚Äîwithout it, you don‚Äôt feel capable of anything. Trust gives you the permission to dream bigger and leap further and feel better. It‚Äôs the basic foundation you jump off to do anything, feeling secure to venture beyond your comfort zone. The simple takeaway is that safety is crucial for having permission to take risks, and the more we can feel safe, the more alive we can feel.The biggest thing on my mind in lieu of all of this is: What are ways you can cater your environment towards providing trust, both your external surroundings as well as your internal headspace?For external surroundings, I think of having an environment with easy access to my friends and community and support system. I think of a city that has cute little cafes peppered across narrow alleyways, hole-in-the-walls serving up hometown cuisine from all over the world, and urban parks with wide green spaces, the varieties of aroma taking me to my next destination: the brightness of freshly ground coffee to the richness of sizzling glucose, and the lavenders and lilacs of the parkside garden. I think of a neighborhood that has cross-pollination across all lines at the seams: parks serving as hubs of community and serendipity, the local taichi group bumping into the cycling squad and the outdoor boxing club. I think of a home that naturally stimulates my creative itch and nature cravings with art and greenery and questions planted all over. I think of a space for deep focus, where my mind can take off to new worlds and different spaces. I think of a space for decompression: a soft cushion for meditation, a plush couch for gatherings, bounds of spices and sprouting veggies and dark roasted goodness. A space for play and for wonder, for intimacy and for lightness, for connection and for reflection.Da‚Äôan Park in TaiepiFor my internal headspace, I imagine I‚Äôm sitting on the smooth wood floor of the platform in a Japanese rock garden, listening to the light breeze flit through the leaves and mingle with the paneled windows. I‚Äôm on a kayak in the middle of a vast lake, snow-topped mountains stretching the horizons, the void of noise broken only by the soft breaking of water. I‚Äôm in the woods following a worn, yet natural trail, mist gathering in gossip circles close to the ground, the crunch of dead leaves and the coo of migratory birds filling the air with a rhythmic chant. I‚Äôm sitting at a cafe feeling the crisp pages of a novel, the ambient sounds of friends chattering near me. I‚Äôm lounging in the couch in my home, a large husky occupying the space next to me, the whimsical sounds of a floating melody setting my mind free as the city sky lights twinkle amongst the reflections of my bright computer screen. In all these visualizations, I‚Äôm safe, and I‚Äôm at peace to explore, to piddle, to tinker and fiddle and play.a zen garden in KyotoWhat do you imagine when you think about your external and internal surroundings?This is the23rdinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>24 - dauntlessness</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/dauntlessness-mini-24100</link>

      <title>25 - silent conversations</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/silent-conversations-mini-25100</link>
      <description>this is my first mini-essay that was composed entirely from my phone as I wandered the city. Some interesting patterns emerge from the medium these thoughts took form in. I did some light editing on my computer to add links that I wanted to add while writing but is impossible to do from your phone.So I‚Äôm in New York City for the next couple weeks and I‚Äôve been trying to really feel the vibe andtextureof the city in my first couple days. Today I‚Äôve been walking around and I wandered into aused bookstorein SOHO. This experience of running my fingers along used bookstore spines and drifting between different visualizations of various authors‚Äô worlds reminds me of when I traveled alone in Prague and had a similar experience. It‚Äôs a strangely spiritual experience‚Äîexploring a new city on foot and by yourself. It involves being intensely in-tune with your emotions and urges. The freedom to do anything can be overwhelming unless you have the courage to prioritize what matters to you, what feels right in the moment.I think it‚Äôs interesting how your purchases are a reflection of your kids and headspace. It‚Äôs like how grocery store clerks can have an intimate understanding of your plans based on what your cart at check out: two handles and a 24-pack and a paper towel roll? You know a rager is going down. Kale, a bag of rolled oats and chia seeds? Someone‚Äôs decided to make overnight oats their life.In the same way that our grocery store purchases show what events or decisions we‚Äôve made, our purchase of ideas and emotions in books and media and art reflect what‚Äòs occupying our heart. What does my purchase of Kafka, Vonnegut, and Kawabata say about my current state of mind and heart? What kinds of conversations do your purchases have without you?Despite how intimate the exchange of goods and ideas is, our transactions and purchases have for the most part become a lifeless interaction. Transactions are optimized for efficiency for the capitalist machine. Time means money and intimacy doesn‚Äôt have the same ring to it as compounding interest.We need to slow down to take it all in, but the city asks you to do more, to be faster. These pockets of intimacy (like this bookstore) give you a handle to pull yourself out of the flood and take a breath. What else offers an opportunity to pull ourselves away from the constant going and instead observe from the passing in?This is the25thinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>26 - do more, be more</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/do-more-be-more-mini-26100</link>
      <description>As I‚Äôm exploring and steeping myself more into NYC while I‚Äôm visiting, the things that stand out most to me are the ones that are most different from what I‚Äôm used to in my default environment of San Francisco.Today after work, I ran through Manhattan through Central Park as the sun was just starting to descend behind the towering skyscrapers, and I was treated to the burst of colors reflecting off the ample glass surfaces in the city‚Äôs skyline.One immediate thing that stands out to me is howalivethe city feels. There‚Äôs this overwhelming sense of energy and bustle that seeps out of sidewalks and bodegas and luxury apartments. People in all different contexts of life are taking to the streets for their evening plans: tourists heading towards their dinner, office workers heading to the gym, students taking a night off. The sidewalks on busy streets ¬†are large and still struggle to accommodate the crowds that overtake them. It feels as if the city is pushing you to rush forward, charging towards some inevitable end point. Even while running I felt this pressure‚Äîmy first mile was a sub 7min which I haven‚Äôt hit in a run since my cross country days in high school.Passing through Central Park, I felt the energy take on a different shape. Compared to SF, there is so much more diversity in hobbies and what people do. Just this one pass through the park, I found:artist using sculpture as a modelhockeyroller skatingskateboarding tricksbadmintonboxingbasketballand more that I can‚Äôt remember nowThe energy manifested into specific activities that people have adopted into their routines. New York feels like a bee hive: the activity never dies as the city never sleeps, and everyone bustles around each other focused on their own tasks.Which got me wondering, how do people feel about doing nothing in this sort of environment?I‚Äôve only had a small sample size thus far, but most people I‚Äôve talked to have expressed a conflict of wanting more freedom to chill while inevitably finding themselves oversubscribed to high-energy events and full-day activities week over week. This energy of aliveness and fun and exploring can take a dark turn when the pressure becomes overwhelming. The underlying pressure pushes you to do more, to be more. New York is a city for the hustlers: it‚Äôs the city of rags-to-riches stories from the projects and immigrants forging a new beginning and students scrapping for a breakthrough. The story the city tells you is one of the American dream: that hard work is the key to making it to that inevitable end point, to becoming more than you are now. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much the odds are stacked against you; all you can do is press harder and march further and reach higher.I wonder about the dynamic betweencommitment and obligationof people who live here. I felt that tension from the people I talked to, but I wonder how it affects the hobbies and activities that people choose to take on. Is there a tension with the paradox of choice, of making the right choice of activity to commit to when the options are limitless? Likely for most, it‚Äôs a combination of both. Commitment and obligation both come with the territory of an environment that projects boundless energy and opportunity, which means both the ones you really care about and the ones you just care about because the option is there are attractive options. In the true New York spirit, it‚Äôs kosher to say yes to both.As an example, someone I met had moved apartments in the morning, met up with us to watch a silent film at the Tribeca Film Festival, and then had a paintball appointment in Williamsburg on the other side of town and across the bridge after. I can never imagine having the mental fortitude to go through with all of these arrangements, but perhaps, New York breeds this sort oftoughnessrequired to keep going and never pump the brakes. I wonder if the dynamic is more such that you build endurance from living here and eventually become ‚Äúbuilt different‚Äù or if you just become comfortable with constantly juggling a million obligations and loose commitments.People find it hard to say no to opportunities that present themselves because it feels like you‚Äôre saying no to progress, and under the always-go mentality, it‚Äôs a sin to slow down, let alone stop. But in these situations, you‚Äôre not necessarily saying no to the progress‚Äîyou‚Äôre saying no to this opportunity to have the space to say yes to one that feels right. This goes back to the spectrum betweenthinking and doing. New York is a city for doing. Action is always preferred, and this flows down into the tendency towards directness in speech and ambition in pursuits.It‚Äôs interesting to observe this dynamic because it‚Äôs not necessarily a good or a bad thing, but it‚Äôs an observation that can be leveraged to cateryour environmenttowards how you want to grow. For now, I‚Äôm enjoying that energy and underlying pressure. I‚Äôve always struggled with biasing towards action, and the city‚Äôs presence is pushing my default towards doing, New York‚Äôs special flavor of personality erosion.This is the26thinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>27 - home and fake nostalgia</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/home-and-fake-nostalgia</link>
      <description>Yesterday, I got lunch atTaiwan Chop Housein NYC‚Äôs Chinatown after a hot walk along Brooklyn Bridge. After we sat down and our food started filtering in, I felt like I was transported back to the version of myself from the summer of 2019 when I wasteaching English in Taiwan. Greeting the shopkeepers in Chinese, the vibe of the shop, and the food all contributed to triggering the core memories I have associated with these sensations. Even though I only lived in Taiwan for less than a month and as part of an official program, it felt like home.As I‚Äôve been visiting New York this past couple weeks, the idea of what home means to me has come up several times. It‚Äôs natural to feel some undercurrent of unease when exploring a new place, and every so often while I‚Äôm crawling the shops of SOHO and probing the unassuming vendors of Chinatown, I‚Äôll get hit by a wave of that tension. The mixed, confusing sensation of something seemingly familiar that is just different enough to trigger a bit of whiplash between your expectations and reality. I felt this as I stood outside a long-standing establishment for ice cream serving up traditional Asian flavors like black sesame and taro. I was tasting the flavors of home, of hot musky nights in Houston gorging on black sesame tan yuan or shaved ice topped with taro pieces (a favorite of my dad), but I was in a foreign place, in a different time period, with a different self.we occupy different selves depending on our environmentsI‚Äôve talked before about how we all contain amultitude of selves, and I‚Äôve noticed this phenomenon manifest in new and interesting ways this past week. In the case above, I inhabited the self from when I was in Taiwan for that brief liminal moment when we ate in the cafe. I‚Äôve also been touring the city by staying in different neighborhoods with different friends (first I stayed with an old internship friend in Murray Hill, then I stayed in an Airbnb in Lower East Side with college / SF friends who were just visiting, and tonight, I‚Äôm moving over to a coworker‚Äôs couch in Williamsburg). With each group, I‚Äôve noticed my default behavior and mindset shift slightly to fit the respective social contexts, but whereas before it might have manifested in drastic behavior shifts in levels of extroversion and openness, I‚Äôve become more grounded andcertainin mynull self(our authentic, at-rest self) and even better, it‚Äôs developed into a version more like the sort of person I‚Äôve always admired: unabashedly authentic, ruthlessly curious, optimistically compassionate, and endlessly adaptable.our homes change according to our active selfJust as our different selves alternate depending on our social contexts, I think our idea of home evolves with ouractive self. In the Taiwanese cafe, my idea of home was the mosquito-filled rice fields, the tacky purple uniforms of my teacher uniform, and the endless rotation of breakfast snacks and teas under a dollar. When I‚Äôm in San Francisco, I think about the energy infused in my room, my temple to creation, the threads of unfinished ideas like hidden treasures waiting to be scavenged, and I think about the steady wind and sun and golden light that greets me in the early evening cresting the hills of Golden Gate Park. When you enter a new place, you‚Äôre scrambling to settle into a new self as you pick up signals for what kind of environment you‚Äôve entered, and in that identity purgatory, you‚Äôre also unmoored from a stable idea of ‚Äúhome.‚Äùfake nostalgia: an aching for a past moment that we never experiencedWhenever we think about ‚Äúhome,‚Äù we feel nostalgia, that ache for a past fleeting moment. I‚Äôve been thinking about how sometimes we feel afake nostalgia, the same sort of ache but for an experience or moment we‚Äôve never had personally. How does this even happen, where we associate something we‚Äôve never experienced before with that same ache of memory lane?Summer in NYC has been triggering that a lot for me. For example, I passed by a group of high schoolers in matching tank tops and carrying their basketballs proudly in the street the other day, and I felt nostalgic. I ached for summer days meeting up at the local basketball court with friends, filling the long days with sweat and competition and belonging. I thought about long hours of idleness and boredom, dreaming of the perfect summer yet too drained from the heat to manifest it. I yearned for the shenanigans of a bright summer flame, that unparalleled moment of nail-biting tension and false lights before the definitive spark. I felt all of this even though my summers growing up in Houston comprised of me holing myself in for long marathons of grinding video games under the cool blast of AC because venturing outside in the Houston summer was equivalent to death to me.I felt the familiar nostalgic ache for something that I had never remotely experienced because these fit the canonical set of stories and narratives of summer city life that I‚Äôve consumed all my life. The classic summer rom-coms and summer coming-of-ages and summer slice-of-life‚Äôs are what I‚Äôve internalized as a parallel idea of ‚Äúhome.‚Äù Watching these films in the slightly-cooler-than-summer ‚Äúwinter‚Äù of Houston and bundled under several layers to protect against the relentless AC of the movie theater, I co-opted these fabricated storylines and memories as my own. I‚Äôm not sure how to feel about the fact that this sort of fake nostalgia exists. On one hand, I‚Äôm saddened by the incredibly narrow scope of what our popular media depicts and heartened by the acceleration in the movement to diversify those. On the other hand, I feel like I‚Äôve gained a separate piece of myself that I wouldn‚Äôt have without this media exposure. Regardless, I‚Äôm realizing just how deep the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù of media can impact a person‚Äôs mindset and being and wrestling with how we help to push the world towards a greater scope of what is ‚Äúdefault.‚ÄùHave you ever felt this ‚Äúfake nostalgia‚Äù? What is your idea of home? How would you describe your current self?This is the27thinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>28 - a drop of color</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/a-drop-of-color</link>
      <description>I‚Äôm in the Via riding to Newark. It‚Äôs damp and cool outside, the first nice day in a string of draining, heat-filled afternoons. I lugged my roller bag over to the waterfront in Williamsburg to see the renowned New York skyline one last time in my 20 min wait for a car. I watched the price steadily go up‚Äî$54 then $58 now $64 as I attempted to precisely time the arrival to the airport, not too early, not too late, just the perfect slice of time to get the adrenaline pumping at the possibility of missing a flight.my morning view pre-flightFor some reason, I have a consistent bad habit of getting anxious about getting to things even when I‚Äôve planned out the details. Perhaps it reflects an undercurrent of distrust‚Äîthe tiniest bit of doubt in the confident self-image I project outwards, a grandiose banner, the psychological equivalent of tricks with shadows and lights. There‚Äôs a tension between wanting to make the most of every moment and feeling too tense to enjoy it because of the fear of missing the ‚Äúperfect moments.‚Äù I‚Äôve been getting better at catching myself when this happens and viewing them as opportunities for growth, chances to say no to closing up and focus on being open to the world.As I cross the bridge and weave my way through the crying sirens and jostling trains and humming AC units city, I feel a wave of something with the form of sadness. It‚Äôs that happy-sad post-travel depression that comes with leaving a place that newly feels somehow familiar. It‚Äôs the nostalgic ache for that unadulterated sense of exploration, of slipping into intimacy with a place, of your heart being marked. Even after a couple weeks, I feel like Iknowthe city. It‚Äôs the naive impression that you‚Äôve formed a unique bond with the place you were‚Äîthat the person you are is no longer the person you‚Äôve been. Of course, logically, I‚Äôve only barely scratched the surface, especially given how large and wide and deep New York is, but my heart tells me otherwise. It tells me: this place resonated with a piece deep within you; some part of you craves that intensity and energy and aliveness even as the rest of you aches for the comfort of home and golden hour in the park and a constant cool 60 outside.Empire State Building at golden hour which prompted me to write this haiku:golden hour, summer daysfleeting, yearning memorieshope, for here, for nowIs it a special property of this city that makes it feel this way to leave? The fabled New York City. This evanescent city of fame and riches and culture. The city of brilliant lights and flashing signs, where there‚Äôs just so much to differentiate yourself, yet it always feels like you need todo moreto stand out. It seems to me that only New York City can get away having piles of trash rotting in the streets be ‚Äúpart of the charm and experience‚Äù rather than a health hazard. It‚Äôs the ol‚Äô Hollywood magic, the sense of wonder with a fantastical and contradictory yet comforting image of the city that‚Äôs been instilled into our very bodies and minds. We feel the city through the experiences that we‚Äôve watched and read and imagined even if when we‚Äôve never experienced them in reality (a sort offake nostalgia). And through that, we somehow feel safe entrusting our hopes and dreams with this foreign city. A city of secrets and promises.fromGoodbye to All Thatby Joan DidionI‚Äôm over the border in New Jersey now, and it feels like I‚Äôm taking a piece of the city with me. There‚Äôs the physical pieces: the callouses from the foot-led exploration of the city, a painted pair of shoes and a black sweatshirt embossed with a tiger, a bright yellow bag with red lettering of leftovers,three worn booksfrom the used bookstore that my bag really couldn‚Äôt afford. And there‚Äôs the internal gears and seeds that have been planted: the millions of impressions that a place nudges against your soul. Being in a place shapes you. She makes you want to be more like her, but not in a forceful, do-it-my-way-or-the-hard-way kind of way, more of a slow before-you-know-it-you‚Äôve-changed kind of way, an inevitable shifting of the tide. It‚Äôs like every place is a unique color, and everything you do there is tinted by a drop of that pigment. The people you meet and the trails you travel and the foods you savor and the smells you breathe. Every little thing, from the moment you wake to the moment you return to slumber, leaves apiece of it with you. And before you know it, you look down and find yourself covered in paint, a dazzling, wild, fierce display of pigments and textures, a piece of work that rivals the finest abstract painters. The canvas of your soul.I‚Äôve been really jamming toLMLYby Jackson Wang recently, and my ride out of town reminded me of it somehow (the music video is great and fully directed by the singer too!)üéµ Don‚Äôt leave me, loving youWhatever you doDon‚Äôt leave me, loving you üéµRex also gave me the wonderful recommendation toGoodbye to All Thatwhich I added an excerpt from above, where Joan Didion describes her complicated, precise relationship to the city.

      <title>32 - chasing stability</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/chasing-stability</link>
      <description>sunset over Joshua Tree (more on myinstagram)I caught up with B today and heard about her story of chasing stability. I feel like we all have our own versions of this story (or are still living out this story). It‚Äôs the classic tale of putting in ungodly hours and putting up with degrading positions to work towards your ideal life. We‚Äôre taught that we‚Äôre not worthy at the start and that there‚Äôs an order to how these things work‚Äîwe need to trust the process, to stick to the plan. Some struggle and others adapt to it naturally, but in the end, most of us convert to the mindset of paying our dues in order for us to live our ideal life‚Äîthedownpayment of our laborand respect for the ability to admit to what we want and like and live for. Some of us develop an attitude of deference with respect to our desires. We become apologetic for ourselves and our passions because we imagine that they aren‚Äôt worthy of other people‚Äôs time, certainly not while we‚Äôre still on the journey towards our dream goal. We think that if we put our time in now, we‚Äôll be able to enjoy a life of stability later. In reality, what we find is that the goal post is always moving: the ideal, stable life is always just a bit out of reach. In the extreme case, people never stop chasing that unattainable star and don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôrestuckin the chase.It‚Äôs a fable of chasing after what we can‚Äôt reach, of putting our real life on hold to live out someone else‚Äôs idea of a life, of deferring to society‚Äôs pressures and whims rather than seizing each day, every single fleeting moment for ourselves to enjoy.First, you have to work your way up. Starting from the bottom, it goes: 5. Background Oriental Male 4. Dead Asian Man 3. Generic Asian Man Number Three/Delivery Guy 2. Generic Asian Man Number Two/Waiter 1. Generic Asian Man Number One and then if you make it that far (hardly anyone does) you get stuck at Number One for a while and hope and pray for the light to find you and that when it does you‚Äôll have something to say and when you say that something it will come out just right and have everyone in Black and White turning their heads saying wow who is that, that is not just some Generic Asian Man, that is a star, maybe not a real, regular star, let‚Äôs not get crazy, we‚Äôre talking about Chinatown here, but perhaps a Very Special Guest Star, which for your people is the ceiling, is the terminal, ultimate, exalted position for any Asian working in this world, the thing every Oriental Male dreams of when he‚Äôs in the Background, trying to blend in. Kung Fu Guy.‚Äî one of the opening statements ofInterior Chinatown.This followsattachment theory, where we convince ourselves that ‚Äúif I find X or meet Y or do Z, I will be fulfilled, and life will be good.‚Äù Instead what often happens is that we do this thing which we expect to solve all of our problems, and lots of our problems are still there. What gives? We put all of our hopes and expectations on getting out of our mess on attaining this one goal, so it‚Äôs no wonder it didn‚Äôt meet our crazy expectations. Our entire life becomes aboutchasinga happy life instead of being happy, let alone just living.Tactically, our life naturally teeters between cycles of exploration and exploitation, of chasing something new and relishing something comfortable. However, there‚Äôs a certain kind of mental stability and emotional fortitude that comes with feeling confident in the person you are and the progress you‚Äôre making. Instead of feeling like youneedto chase this lofty goal andneedto achieve it to prove your worth, this stability comes from having an innate sense of value (feelingwhole-hearted) and enjoying the journey that comes with the progression of your craft. I think it takes a lot of deliberate effort to unlock this mindset, but it changes the landscape of what your life looks like. When you‚Äôre present for every moment of the journey, it doesn‚Äôt matter whether you‚Äôre in the middle of a foreign country where you can‚Äôt speak the language or whether you‚Äôre cozied up in an armchair with a book in your home, you‚Äôll feel safe and empowered to not only be yourself but stretch beyond the limits of ‚Äúyouness.‚Äù The comfort in your own skin gives you the capability to push the boundaries of what you‚Äôre able to do and who you‚Äôre able to be. It means you can shape your future one present moment at a time.When we choose a life of chasing stability, we‚Äôre just creating a life of chaos and flux for ourselves. Perhaps, stability is one of those things that can‚Äôt be found. It‚Äôs only when weslow downand enjoy thelittle thingsin life that stability comes to us.I seem to be getting good results from posting questions for people to respond to, so here‚Äôs some more :)What does a stable life mean to you? Where do you get your stability from? What is your story of chasing stability?Feel free to respond in the substack post or reply via email!This is the32ndinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>33 - the same thing</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/the-same-thing-mini-33100</link>
      <description>a ride through the clouds to Hawk Hill this past weekendThey say that insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, yet persistence is the key to success. I think you often have to repeat a wrong thing over and over in order to really internalize a learning. One lesson I have to continually relearn is that the best answers don't come easy, say in the form of a pithy saying or a matter-of-fact statement. The answers you end up holding on to are the ones you discover on your own. The answers that come after days of toiling and coming up short, of long streaks of searching without finding and pushing without moving. We usually determine value based on how valuable others find it, but for these sorts of answers, all that matters is how profound your heart finds it.If only we could go through life and fully internalize the advice and experiences that people share with us, wisdom would be abundant. And by fully internalize, I mean comprehensively, authentically, intimately experiencing those moments and the root memories of those pieces of advice. The pithy but sincere epithets we offer to others and receive in return are backed by meaningful life experiences that have shaped our end outlook. How can we hope to encapsulate all the meaning that's felt in those lived experiences pulsing through our heart and mind and soul with our clumsy words? As a people, we‚Äôve struggled to capture the depths of human feeling through language. The greatest authors and poets and artists of our existence have continually come up short, so what hope is left for us? They strive to bottle up as much emotional impact into a piece in a way that we can use our existing lived experiences as a reference point. The best pieces of media create an accessible gateway into tapping into that well of feeling, a portal into a past state of being. Is there a future where we could experience those experiences as intensely as if we had lived them?I'll frequently try the same thing over and over again just to make sure my assumptions are correct. Sometimes I'm just frustrated and want it to work; I don't care about the underlying mechanics or what little piece is off that I would know if Istudied all the mechanismsof this dynamic life system. I just want to air fry my tofu. Unfortunately, we often don't have that choice and must find our way to a satisfactory conclusion without the crutch. We try and fail and repeat as a way of learning. Perhaps it‚Äôs because we need to convince ourselves that something is wrong at a fundamental level, rather than having primarily to do with chance. Perhaps it's because you need to be a little crazy in order to make something unbelievable happen. So count me in as one of the crazy ones because I'll never be done learning or tire of questioning or give up on reaching. Even if it‚Äôs an exercise in futility, what better way to go than to try, try, and try some more to capture that unimaginable depth of experience and share it as best as you can with the world. Why else are we here if not to try and fail and live and repeat it all over again? The same thing over and over, or so we think. A ritual ofstability, a rock in our lives, but each day different. Maybe what we do never changes, but the way we experience it is never the same.This is the33rdinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>35 - repetition</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/repetition-mini-35100</link>
      <description>Adapted from a note on 08/03:Repetition is the key to success.For any creative (in the sense of literally creating something) literally all about repetition. To get better at anything, the best way is to just do that thing, to chase the fun that you have there and the playfulness you seek. Just pull the thread that feels interesting and see where it leads youhow to take better photos? Take photosHow to write better? WriteHow to code better? CodeHow to make friends better? Talk to peopleHow to be more comfortable being yourself? Be open about who you areA lot of self-help books are structured in this way‚Äîidentifying small steps you can repeat and providing different perspectives to viewing the task with less trepidation and viewing yourself with moretrust.Self-help is all about personal lessons from a personal truth, and sometimes that‚Äôs the greatest pull we need to reframe our mindset.The traditional advice is to ask the experts for advice, to follow a plan, to stick to a routine. But all that‚Äôs misdirection because it‚Äôs just successful people telling you what worked for them.Fear and just doing it is what separates people who feel infinitely prolific and people who are living blank. Stop being halfhearted and wavering on what you want. Do what you want and seek out what you do.Nike really secured a timeless slogan as it‚Äôs evolved into a universal litany to ward off fear and muster enough courage to chase something desired that is hard to get.A lot of whether you do it or don‚Äôt do it comes down to courage and your ability to dive into the deep. It‚Äôs about your level ofdauntlessnessand familiarity with starting from the bottom.A lot of fear comes from the idea that there‚Äôs a kind of person you need tolook likeor a particular character you have tofeel like. That anxiety and fear come from a place of not knowing whether you‚Äôll meet expectations, whether you‚Äôll pull off the magic trick, the art of substituting parts of your identity for a foreigner‚Äôs.from Making of Prince of PersiaThe only way I‚Äôve found for getting better at this is frankly doing it and getting used to being fully exposed. I‚Äôm trying to train my mind to find comfort in the open, to relish the freedom of authentic expression. I‚Äôm just doing it once. And then another time.

      <title>36 - empty mind</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/empty-mind-mini-36100?justPublished=true</link>
      <description>I haven‚Äôt written too much in the past couple weeks with the chaos around myteam switch at workand a dearth of motivation, and for the short things I have written, I‚Äôve felt more self-conscious about publishing. I think part of it is the fact that I blast an email for each thing I‚Äôve written, and it‚Äôs felt almost self-absorbed(?) to be posting something every day if it‚Äôs not up to a certain bar of quality. I‚Äôve felt this more recently as I‚Äôve seen a few people unsubscribe even though I know I shouldn‚Äôt take it personally. It‚Äôs interesting that I wouldn‚Äôt feel this pressure if I just posted without sending the email (which is a possibility, but I figure that some people do want to keep tabs on this experiment even if they don‚Äôt read everything). I‚Äôm reminding myself today that the whole reason I started this experiment is to force myself to create without the traditional barrier of quality filtering because creation is the best way to improve. I want to write consistently in order to get pastthe gapthat usually stops people from developing acraft. With that, I‚Äôm committing to finishing these 100 artifacts by the end of the year. I want it to feel almost as lightweight as me posting myfit of the day, so if I‚Äôm not feeling the creative spirit, I‚Äôll just push myself to send out a haiku or a short poem (thanksAldenfor the tip!). Please do feel free to skip over these essays or skim them if they are starting to feel like a lot as I don‚Äôt want it to feel like spam!With that, here‚Äôs a WIP poem that I wrote to reflect this feeling from a few weeks back.Empty mindDisturbed mindOn the surface a still lakeMirages flowering on the surface.Beneath a raging torrentEmotions unleashing from their resting placeI crave the tranquility of peaceWhile I yearn for the fury of passionTo think is to beTo feel is to liveAnd to act, the greatest feat of all.Focus, the muse of ignoranceAnxiety, the deity of paralysisMy heart a typhoon and my mind the eyeMy emotions whipping, tangling, twistingHalf-spoken desires and half-enacted urgesSurge beyond the torrent‚Äôs maw.I pray to InspirationThat rare apparitionBut what comes forthNothing but empty words and listless worlds.I hear the jeers,I feel my fear.But I swallow my prideand push towards that ever-fleeting light.This is the36thinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>37 - personal panopticon</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/personal-panopticon-mini-37100</link>
      <description>‚ÄúConsider a future device ‚Ä¶ ¬†in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.‚Äù‚Äî Vannevar Bush fromAs We May Thinkon the ‚Äúmemex‚ÄùI came across this tweet today that really connected with a lot of the things that have been on my mind lately:Andy Matuschak@andy_matuschak@mollyfmielkeI spent some time in '19 prototyping a "personal panopticon"; the conceit was that it would record all text (and other structured data) you ever saw on your screen, plus enough metadata to reconstruct context. Then: search! Had to put it down but still think it'd be interesting‚Ä¶5:15 PM ‚àô Aug 17, 2021I‚Äôve been feeling a growing gnawing at the fact that it‚Äôs such a big mental hurdle to find something that you‚Äôve seen online when you‚Äôre reminded of it. We use so many different products and apps, and all of them have their own data and methods of saving that data. Pretty much every app that involves users consuming data and creating data has some method of ‚Äúliking‚Äù things and ‚Äúbookmarking‚Äù things and listing out the ‚Äúhistory‚Äù of things you‚Äôve seen. Why is it that for any piece of content that we‚Äôve consumed or created that we have to search across an ever-growing list of apps and adapt our flow to each of those app‚Äôs custom workflows for finding old artifacts?Companies sometimes provide APIs to give us access to the data, but there are often no strong incentives for maintaining or extending these APIs. In fact, companies canbreak those APIsat any point if maintaining the current state no longer aligns with their interests. Because of this, this universal structured standard for getting data out of apps isn‚Äôt something that we can rely on as end-users. An added issue is that we produce and consume data on many different devices in many different contexts, whether on our computer, our phones, or our TVs and watches and even ourtoasters(?) as the universe of IoT devices grows ever-larger. In order to create a digital repository of all of the information that we consume and all the thought that that input triggers, we need to be able to access the data that we view and create through all these different mediums without relying on those products to provide us sanctioned access retroactively.spencer chang (34/100 mini üìù )@spencerc99Been thinking lately about how to get access to the content we produce on the internet every day. So far I have
1) API that the product may maintain (if they even have one) 
2) scraping from web-enabled apps
3) a one-time data export for GDPR compliant ones

anything else?3:31 AM ‚àô Aug 11, 2021This idea of a personal panopticon solves this problem by proactively capturing all the content you consume and create at the moment of inception and putting it directly into our hands from the start. Recording everything that you‚Äôve ever seen could get tedious, but the important piece is having all the data there in one place in a form that you can control. With this technology embedded on all of our devices, everyone would be able to build their ownpersonal search engineon top of their universe of digital data.This access to and control over our data is what will enable us to buildsituated software, where end-users havecontrol over how their softwareoperates rather than developers and corporations behind closed doors. It‚Äôs not clear how we shift the landscape meaningfully towards a world where this relationship with our digital data is the default for software consumers, but I look forward to the day when we can tinker freely with our software to cater it towards what we want (this is the future I hope to help push towards with my work at Coda).This is the37thinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>38 - digital capitalism</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/digital-capitalism-mini-38100</link>
      <description>Welcome to the internet. What would you prefer? Would you like to fight for civil rights or tweet a racial slur?‚Äî Bo Burnham sings in his Netflix specialInsideIn this song, Bo Burnham exposes the cognitive dissonance and existential angst we experience using the internet daily. In verse after verse, Burnham highlights the extremes of humanity that are enabled on this digital platform. If the internet is a microcosm of real life, it hasall the good and all the badin the world, but instead of getting pieces in varied doses throughout life, it magnifies both aspects right next to each other. Every internet interaction is an opportunity for whiplash with content ranked by how well they will drive engagement.Just nod or shake your head, and we‚Äôll do the rest.In this verse, Burnham hints at the fact that the internet is supposedly doing all that we're asking of it. You can find anything you want, good or bad, and the internet will tune to your preferences based on a binary yes-or-no. In this world, there's no room for nuance or the grey; you're either right or you're wrong because strong opinions and reactions are the best fodder for clicks.Could I interest you in everything all of the time?A little bit of everything all of the time.Apathy is a tragedy and boredom is a crime.‚Äî the chorus of the songUsers of the internet are characterized as "insatiable" and "unstoppable." They are the all-consuming monsters of the endless content available in our digital landscapes. Consumption is the de-facto; it's the expected behavior for a normal internet citizen.Burnham seems to be saying the internet gave us everything and as a result, left us with nothing because when you have everything in front of you, what meaning does anything have? Our senses have been overwhelmed by the flood of information and decision, and we're left to our core job function as venerable Internet users: consuming.InWorn Out, an essay in Real Life Magazine, Drew Austin uses the tech elites' rejection of fashion as an indication of their distaste for the masses. In the piece, Austin demonstrates how the tech industry treats efficiency as king because efficiency is the key to maximal commercialization. Fashion is something free and inefficient. It's a "means of defining the self socially" as Marshall McLuhan describes, and a social definition is irrelevant to how the industry seeks to monetize. The titans, movers, and shakers of the industry treat fashion as a nuisance, preferring tomaximize their decision-making reserveby creating a uniform.Social media platforms thus structure a reality in which all ‚Äúshared appearances‚Äù are also implicit transactions that can and should be priced. As long as fashion is happening in public, from this perspective, it is essentially a waste.‚Äî from Worn OutThis characterization of the top internet companies, as capitalist machines seeking every chance to appropriate public goods for their own proprietary benefit, matches the experience that Burnham describes of the average internet user. The dissonance and whiplash we experience on the web is a result of the endless streams of content that invade our daily digital routines. Complex algorithms crunch millions of data points in order to maximize the amount of content that we click. We are like a gaggle of golden egg-laying geese; One of our most intimate features, our attention, is bought and sold in shadowy markets that we often aren't even aware of. Unlike the fable, these companies are crafty and have coaxed us into the pen with "free" features and utilities rather than trying to cash in on all of our value at once.As long as we have this incentive of efficiently pricing all the interactions that happen on the internet, it's going to feel like a war zone to us end users. I'm not sure what the world looks like without this or how we sustainably fund useful social technology without wrapping it up in a corporate model that maximizes profits. What I do know is that I'm tired of the dissonance and rat race that the internet frequently feels like. I treasure those pockets oflow-pressurejoy,play, andintimacythat we stumble upon in hidden corners and cozy meadows on the internet, and I hope we find a way to make those the default experience.This is the38thinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>41 - decisiveness</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/decisiveness-40100-mini-</link>
      <description>As I've gotten older I feel like I've gotten less decisive. When I was a kid, I was super picky about the foods I liked and didn't like, to the point of refusing to eat if the meal wasn't in my sanctioned list of meals. In my free time, I dedicated myself fully to video games. It was like routine: finish homework, log on and grind the skills. There was a competitive drive to climb the ranks, pick up on the meta game, and hone the finer mechanics. My life fit into a neat schedule, where each commitment received its proper amount of time.As I've gotten older, I've become more uncertain in what I want and what I want to dedicate myself to because of how my goals have broadened. Instead of having singular goals to focus on (maintain a perfect GPA, reach the top tier in League), my life is about more ambiguous matters now. A singular goal just feels incompatible because it feels unsatisfying. I crave the fulfillment of something deeper than a status symbol or passing a societal goal post. While climbing the career ladder is something relatively straightforward, it‚Äôs also limited in its capacity for satisfaction. I feel like we‚Äôre taught to chase things thatlookgood in a society rather than things that give us deeper fulfillment. I like how my friend Oeishi has vocalizedstabilityas ‚Äúcontributing to whatever emotionally fulfills me in the moment‚Äù and wanting to make those moments ‚Äúconsistently present.‚Äù We‚Äôre taught to chase acareer rather than hone a craftI also like how ava vocalizes thatwe have what we wantand we are what we choose; we don‚Äôt need to always derive it from someone or something else. In her post, she quotes Carl Jung who says ‚ÄúA man who is possessed by his shadow is always standing in his own light and falling into his own traps... living below his own level.‚Äù Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to acknowledge our shadow self when it vocalizes something we don‚Äôt want, but part of being decisive is being true to your whole self, even those unconscious desires that we don‚Äôt want to face. An example of one of my unconscious desires is my desire to look good in front of others. My default state is to care about how other people perceive me which puts a lot of pressure on my day-to-day in a new environment because I feel constantly ‚Äúon,‚Äù like I have to constantly perform.I‚Äôm still figuring out what it means to fully embrace my shadow self and live in harmony with it, but in the meantime, I‚Äôm also trying to vocalize the desires that I‚Äôm not bashful about: the things that I‚Äôd shout from the top of the world if asked to profess my allegiance. I'm drawn to optimistic ideals and building real-world utopias rather than getting ahead in an unfair system. I want to believe in futures that seem unbelievable. I want to trust in a hope that seems too good to be true. I want to work towards a world that‚Äôs better than the one we were born in rather than resigning myself to what it is.Part of that stubborn belief in the ability to create something better is embracing play. I‚Äôve had a recent commitment to embrace more play in my day to day, following my intuition for what feels right and my creative urges for what seems fun. I used to flail in my decisiveness when it came to these urges because I worried about looking bad, as part of my unconscious desire to look good in front of other people. This desire often comes into conflict with my intuitive urges for what I want to try because I‚Äôm naturally curious, which is why I gravitate towardspsychologically safe spacesandvibe tribes. I‚Äôm trying to be more intentional in setting up structures that allow me to be more decisive in choosing the things that I actually want rather than following the flow.This is the40thinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/kindness-journal-mini-43100</link>
      <description>For today‚Äôs piece, I wanted to just share a fun thing I started doing this year which is keeping a kindness journal.The idea of a kindness journal is a central home for all the kindness and appreciation that anyone has ever showed you. Whenever you‚Äôre in doubt or needing a pick me up, it‚Äôs an amazing way to kick-start warm, fuzzy feelings naturally. Here‚Äôs some inspiration below for how you can get started.Jasmine ü¶ã@j_asminewangi‚Äôve kept a running list called ‚Äúall the ways i‚Äôve been appreciated, ever‚Äù for the last 5 years. every time someone compliments me or expresses gratitude in some meaningful way i add what they said word for word to the list. it‚Äôs far &amp; away the best gift I‚Äôve ever given myself.3:28 AM ‚àô Aug 24, 2021916Likes47RetweetsFrank ‚òº Bach@francois_bachNext time a friend or coworker gives you props or says something nice about you, screenshot it and drop it into your 'kindness folder' ‚Äî this acts as a great tool to help fight off bad days, imposter syndrome, etc. 

Remind yourself that you are awesome. üåü7:43 PM ‚àô Jan 14, 2021855Likes139RetweetsOne additional augmentation I like is to also record the nice things you say or think about other people (and normalize just texting them out of the blue saying it!). Compliments are one of the few things that are infinite energy machines. It‚Äôs free to think of and give, and each one generates so much equivalent energy in happiness. Why not help put some more joy in the world?spencer chang (42/100 mini üìù )@spencerc99@nickcammaratain the interim i wish it was more normalized to just share a nice memory with someone when you think of it even if its been years since you talked to involved people5:10 PM ‚àô Jan 10, 2021Curious if anyone else has similar methods or other ideas on how to do this!This is the 43rd installment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>45 - re-solved problems</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/re-solved-problems-mini-45100</link>
      <description>After the vegas trip, I was looking through the Google Photos shared album we had set up, and I was incredulous to find that they have added an entire new chat interface. It basically looks like a social network for photos now, chock full of all those traditional features: read receipts, instant messaging, comments and likes. It feels as if people at Google wanted to give Google+ another try... or maybe replicate the tens of other messaging solutions that Google has implemented. Given the prior history here, it was comical to run into this bloated feature in an app that I use often for a very clear need.David Pierce@pierceThis is a great dive into how Google botched messaging for 15 years, and the table of contents BY ITSELF is a truly epic burnarstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/0‚Ä¶5:34 PM ‚àô Aug 25, 20214,378Likes1,048RetweetsI‚Äôm not saying it isn‚Äôt useful‚Äîof course, it‚Äôs useful to just be able to chat within the context of your photos, but it‚Äôs not really where you want to be talking. It‚Äôs trying to take over a job that will never be fulfilled by Google Photos because Google Photos is a photos app, not a messaging one and people will always turn to dedicated messaging and social apps to fulfill that job. Another example that has stuck in my mind when I was shopping teams at Airbnb is what one of the executives of their payments org boasted to me. ¬†They said that they serve more payment volume thanStripeand as a result, have built a more robust system and might even consider spinning it out as a standalone product. Well, it‚Äôs been a couple years since then, and it seems like that proposition never pulled through. I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs nice to talk about in theory, but creating something in the context of ‚Äúthis is a means to an end for a main product and company identity‚Äù will always frame the new platform as second-class, even if itisbetter than any dedicated third-party out there. It shows that generalizability and universal accessibility for software solutions is crucial to how impactful they are to the broader society. Elegance doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs not being enjoyed by a broad group of people.I wonder what it looked like to start development on this project from the inside. I started imagining the product teams that had to work on that and the play-by-play that went through their head. Were they thinking about how the many Google messaging attempts before (Allo, Hangouts, etc.) had solved this already and they were rehashing the same problem again, or did they dive in with blissful ignorance about a "hard, engaging, impactful" problem? It‚Äôs pretty frustrating that so many solved problems are re-solved because they are done for a different company (or in this case just in a different part of the company in a different context). It‚Äôd be fine if we lived in a utopian world, but it‚Äôs even more frustrating that we have many unsolved problems that are the reason for our race‚Äôs impending doom.In the end, we end up with a bunch of "SaaS" providers that try to solve that problem generically for different providers and people, but they are one-size-fit-all solutions to very specific problems. Ideally, we‚Äôd be able to support personal,situated software, so that companies and individuals could build on existing solutions (perhaps open-sourced?) that the community has built to fit their specific needs (one of our driving theses at Coda). In this way, we could continue growing and building upon our knowledge, compounding our returns. It‚Äôs the same concept asdigital gardening, where you cultivate your knowledge over time as you would take care of a garden. How did we end up in a place where some of the smartest people in our society are stuck re-solving the same hard problems and re-implementing the same solutions we‚Äôve seen before?Is it that we idolize hard problems but not useful problems? Does the incentive for copyright and intellectual property driven by profit-seeking companies discourage any sharing or community-building?

      <title>47 - fear</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/fear-mini-47100</link>
      <description>I‚Äôve been absent from my mini-essays for a while because I was devoid of internet over the past couple weeks while I was in Alaska, but I did write some mini-essays that I just had no way to send, so I‚Äôll be publishing those over the next week to avoid spamming all of them at once.written on 09/01The concept offearhas been on my mind lately, most likely because it forms the foundation for my yearly themes the past couple years. In both thegamblingand the "doing over thinking" themes, the emphasis has been on getting out of my head and exposing myself to real risk and possibility of failure in the real world, which has always been a critical fear of mine. I've been trying to reframe my relationship with fear‚Äîto temper the beast that rears its ugly mane whenever faced with a formidable trial.As a child, fear's grip over my actions was even more exacting. Anxiety crippled me the night before exams or presentations, rendering me restless. Panic seized my innards in the critical moments of social interaction, drawing out awkward gaps. Fear paralyzed my muscles when I witnessed wrong being committed and told me to save my own skin. In essence, fear made me a bystander‚Äîboth to negative formative moments in others' lives and my very own life. I was an audience member, experiencing and living the world through how an actor in the shape of me performed on the stage, following the automatic motions that the environment imposed. Fear told me there was a hard script for me to follow, that deviating from the script meant certain failure, a sure way to give up everything I had built thus far.This pessimistic scarcity mindset, one focused on negative possibilities like sunk costs and survival rather than positive possibilities like opportunities and dreams, drastically shapes how you view what's possible in the world. In the former, every new thing is a potential threat to take away all the happiness that you've built‚Äîlife is a series of trials and obstacles that must be overcome for the sake of what you hold precious. In the latter, life is a series of opportunities for growth and expanding your perspective of the world‚Äîevery new encounter is a gateway to a new story, a new chapter to add onto the vast ever-growing record of your being. Your core mindset and belief system are often self-fulfilling. If you believe in a bleak future, you will find it, and if you believe in a bright future, you'll find spots of brightness even in the deepest darkness. Fear is the force that pushes you into the pessimistic mindset, to distrust the world and fight for survival, instead of having any hope of your dreams to come true.I've talked before about the importance ofdecisivenessandtaste, which is the first step in being able to achieve your dreams‚Äîactually knowing what you want. The next step is being able to actually follow through. Following through is where your relationship to fear is crucial. When you have to translate your thoughts and opinions into action, it requires courage to ward away the fear and do what you say you want, to align your actions with your words in a reality where the risks are very real and not theoretical scenarios. Living without fear is a privilege.Even though I've set this intention to bet on more risks and translate thought into action, it's still incredibly difficult to actually act in the moment on instinct‚Äîthere's always a hesitation that I need to force myself through. I've been able to short-circuit this obstacle in a lot of cases by committing myself to scary things in advance in order to avoid that critical moment, like signing up for writing workshops and dance classes, scheduling calls or emails to be sent in the near future, or publiclycommittingmyself to some goal (like this100 mini-essays experiment). However, this cheat gets me out of really practicing being able to execute on instinct alone in critical moments where you can't mull or waver over whether you're going to do it or not‚Äîyou just need to do it.Now that this theme has been on my mind for a while, I've started to see it all over popular media. InDune, there's a Litany against Fear that the Bene Gesserit teach to calm your mind for action when it's seized by fear in high-tension moments. Dune also touches on the theme of fear in the presence of a drug that grants the ability to predict the future unreliably and how the Guild, which always chooses the clearest safe path, is stuck in stagnation because they don't want any risk. They waver on decision and as a result, lose their control. In one of my favorite shows,Jujutsu Kaisen, Megumi is fearful of stretching beyond the limits of his skills because he has a surefire way to sacrifice himself and take anything else with him. When he finally lets go of his fear and trusts his instinct completely, he's able to reach an entirely new level of skill anddefeat a powerful opponent. The most recognizable instantiation of this theme is in the slogan "Just do it." Condensed to the most basic components, the solution to fear is to push past it and just do what you want to do and acclimate yourself to that feeling of conquering your fear for the sake of your desires."I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to tpsass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."‚Äî the Litany of Fear from DuneFear is the poisonous belief that you aren't prepared for what lies ahead. Courage is trusting yourself to get through whatever obstacle presents itself to you, to believe that you won't give up in the face of any adversary for the sake of what you want. Courage is doing yourself and what you value justice by fighting to carve space for it in the world.This is the47thinstallment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.

      <title>beautiful internet</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/beautiful-internet</link>
      <description>Tsherin Sherpa, Untitled, 2019, gold leaf, acrylic and ink on canvasI've been reading Sally Rooney'sBeautiful World, Where Are Youlately. I'm about halfway through now, and so far, it's a beautiful showing of the beauty in "ordinary" life. The summary isn't much to write home about:It's about things that happen in normal life: friends and lovers, career hopes and worries, hobbies, purpose, coffee in the morning and wine at night and the weird, dumb, boring thoughts that pop into our minds throughout it all.Normal Life is a difficult topic to write about. Other than the obvious fact that everyone has a different sort of "Normal Life," there are a lot of problems even if you want to write about your general life experience (growing up in X part of the world, under Y external conditions and environments, as a Y sort of person), you can overdo it and artificially focus on things that are boring or that people don't actually care about. You can also under-do it and be too abstract and grandoise for anyone to actually relate to. I think its especially hard because it's what everyone goes through every day. There's a balance to writing authentically, like you would in your diary, but also weaving together a compelling story and cutting the fluff for each part of the text to reallypopto life.1Living as an Instrumentspencer chang üí´‚òÇÔ∏èüç• (100/100)@spencerc99‚ÄúAnd in that way even the bad days were good, because I felt them and remembered feeling them. There was something delicate about living like that--like I was an instrument and
the world touched me and reverberated inside me.‚Äù3:24 AM ‚àô Jan 31, 2022Rooney makes the comparison to going through life actuallylivingit andfeelingthe ordinary things that happen to being an instrument‚Äîvibrating in response to the world. That's the key to finding beauty in the mundane.2I've thought a lot aboutresonanceas a principle to seek out because it feels like a morefullway of living. I hate talking about lives as a thing to compare the ability to livebetter, but the periods of my life where I've had a lot of resonance have truly felt like I wasmore alive. It feels like there'sendless possibilityto live for.I think this feeling of infinite potential (playing infinite games) is the key to finding beauty and meaning in everything we do. That's how I've always interpretedoptimistic nihilism3, and it seems like one of those things that determines your fundamental default orientation towards life.A Better InternetI spend a lot of my time thinking about software and the internet both because it's one of my crafts and because it's something that I spend so much time on. Given that, it's natural that I feel a lot of dissonance around the fact that a lot of the internet is not only unhealthy but actively harmful to our health. With all the positive capabilities it‚Äôs enabled (and all the positive potential it has), I'm very hopeful for how we can shape the future to be more and more empowering, enlightening, and intimate.I'll focus on intimacy for this post because that's the feeling that spoke to me after reading this passage. I want an internet that will empower me to share these beautiful moments with the people I care about. We get these now in little pockets of coziness and moments of joy, whether it's a quarantine group dance zoom or doing little doodles together in skribbl.io, or creating acollective storytogether a paragraph at a time, but there's no canonicalplaceto go to for that.How can we make more and more of the web default feel like this and encourage more spaces that enable this kind of sharing and togetherness?I started a recent Twitter thread collecting ideas and vibes that feel like this new kind of web:spencer chang üí´‚òÇÔ∏èüç• (100/100)@spencerc99this is the kind of web i want to seestevenfan@_StevenFanI'm betting on the intimate web: something like a local-first, offline capable bring your own db/crdt/graph/data and play with your friends in data enclaves1:26 AM ‚àô Jan 29, 202215Likes2RetweetsThere's been a lot of talk about a new web lately with the buzz around web3 and crypto things (both very contentious, loose, and ungrounded terms). My perspective is that whatever it really is and however people define it, it is here to stay now, so our job is to make itfeellike the internet and web that we really want‚Äîa collective, pluralistic, intimate, and beautiful one.More to share on that soon...1I think I was trying to train that muscle in my recentmini-essay experiment. I wanted to write purely from my heart but also in a way that was concise and easy for others to quickly understand and parse given the busy lives everyone has and the overwhelming amount of content produced from our busy web.2I had a very brief time doing a series on short stories exploring the beauty in the mundane... one aboutmagicand the other abouta rider3this is maybe the one grand "life philosophy" that appeals to me. TLDR; it's the idea that nothing matters (nihilism), soeverything mattersbecause everything you do is directed by you and the life you have is yours to make. The foundation of nothing mattering means you're free to discover personal meaning rather than some gate-kept Meaning that is dictated from above.</description>

      <title>despair and hope</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/despair-and-hope</link>
      <description>the world feels insane right now. It seems like every time we get a breath of hope, we're crushed by something more awful‚Äîomnicron surge after a sigh of relief, now an invasion and missiles hitting capital cities. I must confess that I've been trying to avoid consuming news and doom scrolling for my own mental health. It sounds and feels terrible but also feels like the only way for me to continue operating amidst the chaos that is ever-evolving and that I feel helpless to stop (of course amplifying and supporting aid, but it feels powerless toreallychange the Geopolitical forces that have been set into motion). And of course, I have the privilege to do this, living in America as safe as I probably can be from the danger and not having any direct family in affected areas. I feel conflicted between this being something thatshouldmake me not operate normally and that the pit of despair and powerless angst is something precious to hold close to my heart‚Äîa permanent, visceral reminder of the cruelty of the world. But this sort of all-consuming melancholy feels so wrong compared to my normal state of optimism and hope.I want to hold both together, like two opposing magnets of innumerable strength, circling each other. A simultaneous solemnness of the gravity of the situation and the real normal lives it is displacing and a seed of hope, a gasp for air, a bird perched in the soul crying out for a better world. How do you think about balancing giving deserved weight and serious consideration to events while also maintaining hope for the future?This is not a Take on the situation as I am nowhere near informed enough to have one given all the nuance and complexity happening and constantly evolving. This is simply my raw, evolving thoughts wrestling how much space there is for both beauty and Goodness along with the grotesque and senseless tragedy. I've been thinking a lot about the normal people caught in the chess of artificial nations andIlya Kaminsky's poemfor our (the privileged unaffected) role in all of this.I wanted to share some exciting things that I've been expending energy on in my life lately‚Äîthings that give me hope about the future if we have the space to craft it free of war and strife.Digital PluriverseThe past month and a half I've poured my heart and soul into the creation of this artifact, an interactive, co-created, living essay that proposes the pluriverse as a banner for the community to rally around as we talk about what a new web might look like. Grounded in history, we leverage the past and how autonomous groups have fought against monopoly and oppressive control by championing plurality without disconnection. Through this artifact we hope to plant the seeds for language that the community can leverage for imagining what a better cyberspace looks like‚Äîa place where many worlds can fit and where we decide what is important rather than large single entities.Also, it's a beautiful site and it's been so rewarding to see this come to life.

I've been a little more hesitant about sharing these because poems feel so much more raw and intimate and I want to try to collect some for submissions... I'm sharing some recent public ones I wrote, but if you're interested in more, let me know and I can send it to you over email :)https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/ablaze-heart/https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/the-gaps/Shapeshifting textI've been fascinated with the idea of "software poetry" lately. By software poetry, I do mean literally poetry rendered digitally, but also software creations that feelpoetic, in that they feel rhythmic and weighty and like they communicate at some deeper, subconscious layer of intimacy.One experiment in this has been open sourcing a package around creatingtelescopic text. Telescopic text is the concept of digital text that expands on click. In this way, you can capture a nugget of an idea while giving users the agency to dive deeper into the underlying story.I created a telescopic poem to try this out:https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/boundless-shapeshifters/Try out creating your own in thetest bed! I would love to see what you come up with.Thank you as always for engaging with my thought experiments and following along with these updates.With everything going on, I hope you keep precious that core of tragedy and try to feel for the normal people like us who are going through terrors and strife never imagined. At the same time, I hope you hold on to a kernel of hope and optimism and have a renewed commitment to creating pockets of brightness, beauty, and compassion in the world to serve as a reminder of what we‚Äôre fighting for when we confront tragedy.</description>

      <description>I've been traveling a bit recently, a retreat for verses in Montreal for 2 weeks, a couple of weeks infected with COVID back in SF, home to Houston for family, and now I'm writing this from a stylish Airbnb in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.It might just be that I caught the start of spring, but I've felt a tangible magic here strolling through neighborhoods lined with brownstones, working from hip cafes, and people watching on the subway.There's a sort ofalivenessthat permeates the city of New York. Sitting in cafes, there's so much life to bear witness to: friends meeting up to catch up, two young professionals sitting next to each other, a pair of lifelong friends sharing old age, two college students grabbing coffee before returning to the grind. There's this sense that Things Are Happening. If you're in a stupor, it rips you out, drags you to confront the fact that people, anyone,everyoneis doing things and that you should be too. It's a brutal forcing function to embrace some sort of passion or hustle. Eat If you want to eat, don't be eaten. If you want to be seen, don't be hidden. If you want to live, don't stay still. You have to carve out an identity that is simultaneously unique and marketable to society.Maybe there's this sense of people just doing whatever they want to do. There's a sort of freedom in being able to find passion and success in whatever you want to do, following your latest obsessions. It's mixed up with all the societal pressure to conform. it forms some sort of hybrid, where you're chasing for a weird contrarian hybrid of clout. You want to be recognized by others, famous in other words, but you want to do so in a way that feelsspecial, different. It's a desire for the best of both, a defiant demand for it all, no compromises.Because so many people are trying tomake it, while forging their own path, there are so many pockets of personality and texture where people have planted their dreams. That's why I feel like people-watching is so fascinating here‚Äîthere are so many different kinds of people with their own styles and drives that I can take inspiration from all day. But because "making it" is tied to having lots of money in our current society, those passions are made tangible in the high cost of creative cocktails, unique dining experiences, and inspirational shopping trips. Things are always changing and to keep up, you have to keep spending along with all your making.spencer chang üåë (in nyc)@spencerc99paying for vibes in nyc but they are immaculate3:00 PM ‚àô Mar 18, 2022There is such a diverse set of rich, textured vibes and visions that are being brought to life here and they are located everywhere. All these visions need money to be brought to life, so they're sustained by the people who live here. In San Francisco, I feel a lot more self-sufficient. This is also definitely influenced by the fact I live in SOMA, which I have referred to as a cultural desert (sorry SOMA), whereas New York might be described as a culturaldessert. As a result, I don't feel really like aregularat a lot of places or an ingrained part of the community whereas I can definitely imagine having that relationship at a bunch of the cafes and restaurants I've visited here. There's also a not totally unfounded aversion to people working on laptops in SF compared to the ample WiFi and space and aesthetics in NYC.One example is this cafe I came across a block away from my Airbnb calledLand to Sea. It's this wonderful Hong Kong-inspired space with a modern, airy front and a provocative, neon-filled backroom.I felt simultaneously comforted by the homey, personal decorations and intrigued by the creative displays of local artist work. As I worked there for the day, I watched the owners get interviewed by one of their baristas and community members have a quick catch-up while waiting for their order. There's an extended community here that forms the basis of acommunity of fate, one that recognizes solidarity and mutualism and will take costly action on behalf of the community.It leaves me wondering how we plant the seeds that will create the environment for communities of fate to emerge. As our generation grows old and starts thinking about making families, will we resign ourselves to the increasingly isolating suburbian living situations of our parents? Or will we forge a new path forward, one that involves interdependence andmutualismwith the broader web of people around us (both physically and digitally)?I know I haven't been posting that much to this newsletter (especially compared to my almost daily posting from mymini-essaydays). I'm still figuring out the best use of this medium of communication... These posts end up being very lightly edited (so similar to my mini-essays) but slightly longer-form and reflective (like my normal posts). I've felt less motivated to dig into concepts and post on my website as posts and more motivated to create collaborative artifacts with others and iterate on some especially meaningful pieces for literary submission.If you have thoughts on what you'd like to read about or what this should be for or just want to say hi, I'm all ears :)</description>

      <title>being open to magic</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/being-open-to-magic</link>
      <description>I've been thinking about the concept of home and digital homelessness recently with a prompt from my friendjasmine, especially with mytime in nyclately feeling out what it feels like to be a part of that community.A lot of people who live in New York talk about the incredible, overwhelming social presence of the city.It's neverending fun.There's always more to do.At the same time, I talked to someone who hadn't found a community that they identified with in New York, like they found visiting SF. I find that dichotomy interesting, how so much of the outward aesthetic of NYC is tied to the enriching social sphere and so much of the SF aesthetic of great nature, tech bros, and unbearable rent is definitivelynotthat.I suspect that friend found what Andy describes as a hard to discover but very real "weird people taking ideas v seriously" scene.Andy Matuschak@andy_matuschakSome cities reveal what I cherish about them much more immediately than others. I've noticed that what I love about SF can be hard for visitors to see. How do you visit "weird people taking ideas v seriously"? How to put that in a guidebook? You've gotta go to the dinner parties.4:26 AM ‚àô Apr 6, 2022220Likes5RetweetsThere's something to be said about the depth of knowledge here. There's a quiet dedication to craft that can be felt that I have found in rare pockets in other places. I wonder if it has to the do with the extremity of the area: the abundance of beautiful nature with the constant fear of petty crime, the rich multicultural history and the Great Gentrification, the flourishing origin of various creative endeavors and the overwhelming societal and economic pressure to beefficientandproductive. Perhaps that constant tension between a beautiful future and a fearful one throws into sharp relief the hopeful vision of whatcould be. We dedicate ourselves to our craft and our purpose and our nature, all the things we love, to preserve that fateful hope for the kind of future we can inhabit.I love that part of San Francisco. That optimistic aura is the indescribable thing that caught my heart in the first place. I moved out as a naive college student dreaming of working at Google to make the world a better place, and I've grown into a semi-responsible adult who grapples with the inherent conflict of putting that ideology into practice, while still dreaming like a child of creating things that make somebody's world better. I hope I never lose that playful part of me‚Äîthe child that jumps for joy over those perfect breezy cloudless days, obsesses over exploring the ends of a new toy, and sheepishly subverts the rules of recipes and guidelines in the hopes of creating a new thing of beauty.some examples of the flourishing creative scenes in communal software (likeDynamicLandin Oakland),dance, andwritingFrom my visit to New York and noticing why I was enjoying the community there so much, I think it's because I was giving so much of myself to the community there as I was visiting, whereas in SF, I'm so settled in now (and used to the heat of COVID quarantine life) that I've neglected to do that. I've grown to be self-sufficient, so I neverneedto rely on or even interact with the different communities here. In so many ways, SF feels like a home because of the vibe that I described above and how I'm able to focus on my creative endeavors, but it felt like it was missing a piece of that community I found in New York.While I think the density of New York makes it a lot easier todiscoverthat community there, SF has plenty of that to offer. I think I just need to do a better job ofopening myself up to the magic. I do this to a lot of success with nature (well it's not hard given how much of it is around the city)‚Äîoften telling friends who question my relationship with SF that I fall in love with the city again every time I see golden hour bathe the bridge and the waterfront in dazzling lights and the steady red blinking of Sutro Tower set against the purple and orange horizon.a recent golden hourI think the key is to stay fully settled in yourself while opening yourself up to opportunities and experiences that might be fulfilling. I'm reminded of the idea of micro-interactions from theConvivial Societyand Jane Jacobs and how every interaction is an opportunity to connect with the community. In the spirit ofmutualism, I want to open myself up to the community through these micro-interactions.Any suggestions or ideas for finding or engaging with these micro-interactions with the community? Let me know!</description>

      <title>quarter life commitment</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/quarter-life-commitment</link>
      <description>I'm 25 as of today1. I didn't do anything differently to celebrate; I just did everything I normally do with some extra flourish. I woke up, made my bed (actually tucked in my sheets), made some coffee (a shakerato), and prepared a simple breakfast (tamago kake gohan). I opened my shades to a beautiful San Francisco day, a cloudless blue sky and ample sunshine to stave off the relentless wind.tamago kake gohan with the fixingsThey say you're supposed to have an existential crisis when you turn 25, but this year feels light. I recognize my crippling existentialism lurking in the corner‚Äîit seems satisfied staying in the shadows of my soul's home.I have a little reminder that shows me my notes "on this day" a year ago, which includes myreflection on the mid-twentieson turning 24. My existentialism was out and dancing then. My reflection reads as a winding wish list or a prayer litany.I'm free now and I want to use that freedom for the things I love. It feels like something you'd write at the cusp of a change, a piece of "faking it" that you write to convince yourself that you're different from who you are in the moment. As is my tendency, it ends on an optimistic note, but you can't help but feel like there's an undercurrent of yearning that is being covered up by hopeful placards.A snippet from that reflectionI watchedEverything Everywhere All At Once(do yourself a favor and go watch it if you haven't seen it) the day after, which was fitting given the existential theme. Through a set of infinite consciousnesses, it tells the story of how humans can teeter between the edge of pure nihilism (nothing matters) and unstoppable kindness (this moment of kindness is all that matters) and arrives at a point of optimistic nihilism (every tender moment is worth fighting for, no matter how few or far between). It's beautiful, moving, funny, technically masterful as a work of film and acting, and it does so all to insist‚Äîlovingly, persistently, hysterically‚Äîthatwe matterfor no reason of greatness other than being us and being here. We don't need to prove our worth to the world, to our infinitely more "successful" selves. The moment we're in‚Äînow, this very second is what matters to us. It's a message of hope, a call to arms for us to fight for the world we want to see. To fight with love and beauty and an appreciation for all the weird, peaceful, sublime moments of our lives. Fighting to gift these moments to others, seeking understanding, towards a more whole knowing of others.a still from the movieAt the turn of my quarter life, I'm feeling grateful, settled, hopeful‚Äîprimed to fight for what I love and believe in.Grateful for all the love and inspiration and laughs and fun in the people that inhabit my life and the exchange of these invisible substances, winding their way through invisible trails connecting us.Settled in my pursuit of craft, how my passion ebbs and flows between hobbies in constant pursuit of creation and beauty and mediums for connection.Hopeful for the flourishing of a world where we're all dreamers, and it isn't sad or conflicting to want to be and say you are one.I've been saying I'm not existential, but that's not quite true. I'm existential in the sense that I'm reflecting on living and being. People always associate being existential with a negative connotation, with questioning the meaning of everything and being unsettled by the silence that follows.Can you be hopeful and existential? I've been wondering how life can be so good, how beauty can be so ample, how passion can be so intense, how kindness can go so far, how laughter can echo so deeply, how a smile can turn around a day and a name can be the portal to a new world and a rambling reflection can be a lifeline in the dark. I'm thinking about how we can exist in a world that contains tender raindrops that slip down misty windows, billions of burning rocks that dutifully perform against the shawl of our universe, ladybugs that curiously creep up your finger, the way fresh vegetables share the history of their essence, seas that look like an oil painting, layers upon layers of contrasting gouache.I can't help but feel overwhelming love for the space we inhabit and stubborn hope for our agency to form societies that empower everyone to feel this way. That we will burn optimism as fuel for creating something better for our community. That we believe in our ability to make change and be fun and show love, even if just to ourselves.I hoped for all these things last year and somehow it feels like they have manifested in flesh and bits and neural activity. I'm doing the things I love, emotionally surrounded by people I love, growing in the ways I want. I don't think I'm perfect‚Äîawareness of my flaws is part of what I seek. But I wouldn't change anything I'm doing. I just want to keep going‚Äîtowardsmutualistic flourishing.I know I'm naive; I'm a dreamer. But maybe we should get our hopes up for things sometimes. Maybe we shouldn't dampen how we feel to avoid the possibility of disappointment. Maybe we should hope for and demand everything‚Äîask for the world, the stars, and the ever-expanding universe for ourselves. Maybe na√Øvet√© is how we keep imagining in vivid colors, connecting with rich feelings, dreaming of diverse characters.river trails outside an airplane window, shot on my iPhoneEvery day I'm searching for perception. The ability to perceive as much of the rich detail that pervades every moment of my life. I don't want to shy away from who I am or what I like or how I feel or who I love. I don't want to avert my eyes from ugliness or sadness or absolute bat-shit craziness. Living is about experiencing it all. Being is about feeling the threads of energy that connect us all, your enemies and towering redwoods and adorable squirrels. Existing is about breathing in the fullness of every second. And I'll fight to breathe deeply every day, again, again, again.1to be completely accurate, I wrote this two days ago on April 9</description>

      <title>glacial illusions</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/glacial-illusions</link>
      <description>I'm sitting in a cute coffee shop in Amsterdam trying to undo my jet lag adjustment before my flight back. I really love the coffee/cafe culture here. Not only is the coffee excellent, but also there's an attention to details that offer homeyness, like a side cushion for drinks, vibrant plants, and a light-filled space. It exemplifies the sort of mid-century, modern living that permeates the city: the bike-filled streets, the abundance of upscale furniture stores, the neat rows of brownstone houses.I've been thinking about what it feels like to be perceived by others and how that resulting pressure changes how you act. I have a history of my authentic identity feeling repressed by some pressure to embody the "right" image in whatever social environment I inhabit. If I broke up my life into arcs, this would characterize the biggest character development arc, one to unlearn this automatic conforming.I grew up learning how to be a chameleon. I learned to perfectly blend into my surroundings to avoid drawing attention. Survival via obscurity was encoded into my very being. Even being "successful" was a form of obscure survival. Being successful as a kid meant finding a good professional life that many in society sought‚Äîthe stable, "normal" life that you were supposed to work towards. The American dream story of working hard, having a large social circle of friends, and coming back to a happy family every day.At some point, I realized that the dream was a mirage‚Äîthat hard work sometimes made you worse off than not working at all; that friends come and go and intimate connections can be found in the most ephemeral of places; that a happy family is really a composition of millions of infinitesimal daily commitments to working on it rather than a one-and-done deal. Life is a series of illusions. I learned how to weave my own, an image to appeal to everyone.Now, I'm learning to leverage my shapeshifting intentionally. I met someone recently who chose different names for different parts of his life. He had a wardrobe of identities for meeting new people. Instead of the conventional advice to always be yourself, which I find too general and pithy to be useful, this gives you the freedom to embrace multiple identities. We're always inhabiting an identity, and our "real selves" can manifest as so many diverse embodiments. I'm thinking of the parable of theblind men and an elephant, how there is an incomprehensible amount of detail to be perceived even in one person. When others perceive you, they're only experiencing such a small portion of your constellation of being. That's not to say that the amount they are experiencing is small in absolute terms‚Äîrather, your fullness of being is so deep and always expanding. So much so that we spend our entire lives learning more about ourselves, how our bodies curl in the shape of an aubade in the filtered dawn light, how our hearts swell to bursting at the sight of a crush, how our minds can leap between mental and emotional universes at the drop of a word.Being able to see others is a gift. It's an opportunity to comprehend a piece of an infinite world. We're living in a glacial field, millions of icebergs bobbing together in the sway of salty ocean waves. We drift together and break apart. We shine beautifully in the evening light. We hide bulks under the surface in our hearts.I want my infinite identities to reflect what I find most compelling in every moment. To use my shapeshifting in a way that amplifies the goodness in the world rather than blending into the background. To fight with kindness. Always. Waging war on behalf of our little field of ice in the wide ocean, all for the fleeting moments we share drifting together. And isn‚Äôt it nice drifting here, in this moment?</description>

      <title>software poetics</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/software-poetics</link>
      <description>I've been spending a lot of time thinking about how software can be a medium for art, expression, and poetry lately. In college studying computer science, creating software was always framed from a perspective of efficiency, generalizability, and scalability. We needed to find ways to make algorithms that could run fast enough, components that could easily compose, systems that would be sustainable in the long-term. We created systems that weregoodat what they did, but we didn't go beyond their actual ability to function to think about what they could be good at doing. The result is billion dollar companies and thousands of very valued startups that are built on marvelous engineering systems but have questionable secondary effects or actually don't help people do what they want to do (or sometimes even what the creators intended for them to do).Maybe because of this, I never reallygotpoetry growing up. I didn't understand its purpose. Sometimes it rhymed and sometimes it didn't. Sometimes they followed proper grammar and sometimes they didn't. Sometimes they invented new words and other times, they used the same words in new ways. As opposed to one of these engineering systems I was familiar with, which was designed to be provably "good," poems had no "proof" for their goodness; often, they were inherently illegible.I became intrigued by poetry again at the end of last year. I started getting poetic exposure through more poetic and rhythmic prose, and I really loved how poems could capture so much specific and intense feeling in such a small amount of space. I worked throughThe Best American Poetry 2021anthology and from some of those works, experienced the wonder of mystery for the first time. Mystery had always felt negative to me. I was uncomfortable withnot knowing, with the ambiguity of meaning. I liked black-and-white things. I craved total understanding, relying on analyses of analyses of analyses to make my decisions large and small. Reading some of these poems, I experienced how uncertainty can be beautiful. I saw how questions without answers could mark a heart.Along with reading more poetry and writing more poetry, I wanted to see if I could merge the composable, efficient systems of software with the enigmatic and playful and boundless verses of poetry.In that vein, I've worked on a few software poetics that I want to share with y'all :)8-byte: pacman poemI worked on this withkelseyas a submission for the 8th issue oftaper, a computational poetry magazine. The idea is a subversion of the classic pacman, where instead of eating food, the player eats words to make their own poem. The words come from a very limited word bank, but because they are curated to be multipurpose, the limited word set and constraints of movement on the grid provide a lot of fun playability. I'm really interested in how constraints can enable creativity, especially with writing (whichMatthewhas and is doing great work looking into).A small version of it has been accepted (the limit is a 2kb HTML file), but I made a full version available on my website, where you have a history of all the games you've made and the ability to submit to a public gallery. It currently just goes into this coda doc, but I'm thinking of using this as an experiment to use coda as a database, which basically acts as a hosted version ofbaked data architecture, a concept of using a static file as your database for ease of use and modification.https://spencerchang.me/pacman-poeminteractive twitter poemsOne of the poems that really resonated from the 2021 Best American poetry anthology was "Love" byAlex Dimitrov. It turns out he has a separateTwitter accountwhere he continually writes this poem, one line at a time (and a new one calledloneliness).I built the Twitter Pack for Coda recently (an integration that lets you live-sync data from Twitter into Coda, where you can take action on it), and I thought this was a great way to show how you can combine poetics with the composability of software. Bringing Twitter data into Coda allows me to leverage these general building blocks that Coda provides, which enables me to make a randomizer for lines of these poems (and color code which poem it's coming from).https://coda.io/@spencer/twitter-poemsspencer chang üåë@spencerc99made an interactive explorer for@alexdimitrov's twitter poems (@apoemcalledloveand@apoemloneliness) so you can cycle through random ones, search them, and save your favorites for a rainy daycoda.io/@spencer/twitt‚Ä¶5:18 AM ‚àô May 19, 202216Likes1Retweetverses verses: transforming poem playgroundThis is an expansion of the telescopic text open-source library I worked on withJacky.

      <title>in search of awe</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/in-search-of-awe</link>
      <description>some mountains in Alaska that I was awed by‚ÄúHow are you? How are ya doing? What‚Äôs up?‚Äù I simultaneously hate and desperately need these questions. They leave all the work to the answerer. You have to decide how much space to take, how deep to delve into their fantasies, how much the asker truly cares. Answers can range from ‚Äúfine‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on the verge of a breakdown‚Äù to ‚ÄúThe day I turned 5... &lt;insert anecdote&gt; That‚Äôs how I knew I would find myself one day eating the best pastrami sandwich of my life from the deli down the street.‚Äù At the same time, they‚Äôre the most legible way to be curious about someone‚Äôs life and give them the permission to take space. They can be unassuming and generous gifts.I‚Äôve been trying to take more space, even benarcissistic, so I‚Äôve resolved to answer these in excruciating detail to try an extreme from my normally short answers of ‚Äúfine! still writing! still trying to enjoy life!‚Äù I want to answer the way I would write an intimate journal entry about the latest thing on my mind that has consumed my entire attention. Rather than shallow breadth, I‚Äôm aiming for intense depth.But lately I‚Äôve been struggling to answer how I really am. I‚Äôve told people I‚Äôve feltliminalhaving friends in various states of transition, whether switching jobs, changing cities, or diving into new relationships. All of this change makes a part of me wonder, should I be moving in more dramatic ways too?Life has been feeling a littletoostable. It certainly hasn‚Äôt been boring or static‚Äîevery day I still wake up excited to live. What‚Äôs missing is that I haven‚Äôt felt like I need to fight for my life in a long time. In other words, I‚Äôve felt safe and rooted in my routines of passions and people. I‚Äôve been able to more fully embrace abundance lately than probably ever in my life.One way to read all this is that I‚Äôve won against scarcity and fear. All my past struggles and uncertainties have lead me to this moment of feeling steady on my feet, the world open and waiting before me. I spend my days steeping in and dancing with and making beauty, function, play, magic with people I admire and laugh with. My relationship with my career is one ofcraft, where I feel motivated to work for the joy of learning and creating meaningful work, rather than one of artificial political progress. I feel the agency to leave if the situation ever changes. I‚Äôm surrounded by loving friends and continue meeting more lovely people! And every day I feel more capable of expressing my honest feelings moredirectly, more openly. My poetry practice feels like it‚Äôs really blossoming. I can make a freakishly good ËõãÈ§Ö. I tookChris Martin‚Äôsclass the other day and actually survived?Another interpretation is that I‚Äôve become really good at hiding from the things that really scare me. I‚Äôm pushing myself in all the safe ways and I‚Äôve forgotten the thrill that comes from uncertainty of survival. I convince myself that I‚Äôm flourishing when I‚Äôve just lost the courage to risk losing. I‚Äôm staying in a safe job and growing my craft in the directions that I‚Äôve already become familiar with. All the time I spend blossoming friendships are excuses for confronting why I haven‚Äôt been in a relationship in 3 years. My emotional and artistic practices are tip toes forward rather than leaps. Dancing is a crude hedge against the social anxiety I feel.I‚Äôm reminded of thedauntlessness of Omar Sy, his uncanny capacity for diving in the deep end over and over. I‚Äôve been hardening around the shape of feeling protected. I‚Äôm wary of pursuing growth for the sake of growth in the way that modern society has pressured us to become ‚Äúentrepreneurs of the self.‚Äù I don‚Äôt like growth porn, and I‚Äôm skeptical of the effectiveness of blind leaps into dark pools for healthy growth compared to exercising uncomfortable rebellious acts in safe circumstances and teaching your muscles that these things, in fact, won‚Äôt kill you. And looking back I still can‚Äôt believe how much I‚Äôve changed and at the same time, fundamentally remained unchanged from that kid who felt scared to interrupt class to use the bathroom. I can‚Äôt imagine myself not creating the space for me to go to the bathroom when I need to now, but I can definitely still call up the fear that comes from inconveniencing others on demand. Humans are built to change and adapt to new patterns of dancing. But maybe I‚Äôve forgotten what the change feels like. I‚Äôm aching for more extreme tests of my discomfort. As much as I dread it, I also do kind of miss the rush of feeling like my body‚Äôs going to explode with anxiety and excitement. I miss the ache from stretching myself too hard, my fear-producing guards of propriety learning how to loosen. Perhaps this mental shift is precisely the sign of growth I‚Äôve been searching for most of my life. The physiological shift to interpreting anxiety as excitement and vice versa.I wouldn‚Äôt be true to myself if I tried to ignore growing altogether. I enjoy getting better at things, relish fruitful exploration. In high school, I spent all my waking moments outside of schoolwork churning through League of Legends matches. I drilled coding challenges until I didn‚Äôt feel like an imposter. Even if I enjoy moments, I‚Äôm never fully satisfied. The curious part of me always itches for more, to see the world through the eyes of mastery. It‚Äôs an obsession with competency.I‚Äôll never get tired of working to feelmore. To fall even harder in love, to feel even more gratitude for the people who‚Äôve gotten me to where I am, to yearn for more and more of the world to the point that it hurts. The times I‚Äôve been the most depressed have all been periods where I‚Äôve felt stagnant. Blocked from growing in the ways I want, from feeling more and more of the world. I‚Äôll never be satisfied even as I enjoy every moment. I‚Äôll keep asking for more of the world for more of life for every second to be suffused with the feeling of eternity. I‚Äôm obsessed with growth because I‚Äôm addicted to awe. I live for the moments where it feels like the world‚Äôs stopped, and your life feels like a made-up miracle in the dream of a children‚Äôs book. The moments where the most obvious things suddenly feel like feats of impossibility.Sitting by a cliff on a clear night, a slice of the Milky Way unfolding her beautiful layers. Plants blooming. The ever-changing chorus of waves on a seashore. Being alive. How ice cream envelopes the tongue on a hot summer day. How much of a person‚Äôs life you can see just from their hands. How breath relaxes your body. How we can give so much love and take so much of it away.I admit I‚Äôm hooked on growth and the awe you find in her seams. But it isn‚Äôt something that needs to be healed or fixed. I‚Äôm an addict, and I‚Äôm proud.</description>

      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/a-meditation-on-adventure</link>
      <description>I barely slept last night. The unofficial fireworks (I presume in celebration of Pride) and loudspeaker music (an occasional phenomenon) from the streets didn't help. But what really kept me up was the energy brewing in my navel. The fire stoking in my gut. The current churning in my diaphragm. My body felt like an ecological disaster waiting to happen.I get really tense before adventures. Normally subconscious actions become a negotiation with the stress budding from my roots: washing the dishes becomes a race, procrastinating on packing on random Youtube barber vlogs transforms into providence. I feel legally liable for finishing my last mango.My plane is departing the tarmac now. When I "woke up" this morning, the city was swamped with fog. If this was a movie and I was the main character, a film critic might break it down as a metaphor for the city's mood towards my departure, a somber farewell. When I boarded the plane, the at-first mysterious and now comforting mountain ranges lining the San Francisco Peninsula erupted from the cloud line and the sun broke out. As if to say, the dark is ending ‚Äúeven if you are not ready for the day.‚Äùa mesmerizing view leaving the baySome periods of my life are easily narrativized. Specifically, the ones that mark significant growth. There's something about a transition that preps your body to stretch in ways it‚Äôs never had to before. I'm moving through a transition, and I'm not sure how my body will react.I'm sitting by a window with a great view. I love picking the window seat. There‚Äôs a little-known art to it. Windows aren‚Äôt spaced out evenly with the seats, so you need to find the numbers that naturally let your head rest against the divider. You also need to pick a seat that's far enough in front of or behind the wings to ensure you have a clear view. Only then can you easily, romantically gaze out the window, lost in enlightened thought. All while your seat neighbor has a different sort of enlightenment writing up a Google Doc with tables and pros and cons and words like ‚Äúcoordination‚Äù and ‚Äúinstrumental‚Äù and ‚Äúvalue-add.‚ÄùFrom the window, I‚Äôve gotten better and better at recognizing spots, familiar ones from an unusual perspective and new ones from a one-of-a-kind introduction. Landmarks like Lake Tahoe and Yosemite feel unfathomably knowable, despite how you could spend a lifetime exploring their nested layers.I try to recognize spots and remember them because my sense of home is pretty grounded in my physical space and inhabitable places. I love to travel but a nomadic lifestyle sounds terrifying. I really love having a home base because there‚Äôs a safety of return at the end of the day. I imagine if I ever become homeless I would be stuck forever because of how unmoored I would feel. Leaving SF for the rest of the summer makes me emotional. When I was watching the sunset earlier this week, I noticed so many more details, let myself linger to soak in some final dredges of local beauty. I'm scared that I won't be able to enjoy what I love somewhere else; I'm scared that I'll fall in love with a different home.I used to fight against the parts of myself that I thought kept me from doing the things I wanted. My fear of doing scary, new things was my enemy. My anxiety with high-pressure situations and leaving comfortable routines was a parasite. I never succeeded in getting rid of them, and now understand them as a part of me. I think they might even be my greatest strengths if I let them. The fear comes from an uncanny ability to observe and discern possible dangers as well as opportunities. The anxiety comes from a yearning to grow out of my existing boxes, an impatience to stir up my bones and existing mindset, an intense commitment to giving everything I do my all.I recognize that tension in my body as the sprouting of pure energy. My body dutifully preparing to make the most of this arc, powerful streams rising from my body like steam, how the fog rises over the glass and earthen hills of San Francisco. I‚Äôm hungry and sleep-deprived and overwhelmed by the million things I‚Äôll need to do, but somehow all this jittery energy, which has always felt like crippling nervousness, now feels grounding. The tension in my belly reminds me what it's like to be really alive, an involuntary pinching to validate that this is real.The tension is unfolding, taking space under the sun and soaking up every ounce of beauty. Carefree yet poised. Frenzied preparations followed by frenzied exploration.I'm greeted by a fresh heat as I step out of the airport. I see patchworks and hodgepodges, of colors, languages, and construction materials, stream by as I ride the rush hour traffic into the city.I'm keeping Adventure waiting, so I better get going.P.S. pls send me recs for New York City and especially Brooklyn (I'll be staying in Prospect Heights) for your favorite food, activities, thrifting, unique/cool local events. I'll be here for the next 7 weeks!</description>

      <title>loose fear</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/loose-fear</link>
      <description>new york light &amp; shadowPeople complain a lot about the ever-present noise in New York, but I actually like the random stream sounds here. With more people and more normality of interaction, I'm more on edge here. I'm scared of exposing myself, expressing myself fully, laying my soul bare for all to see. The barrage of noise serves as a centering reminder, a jarring meditation bell: ‚Äútake it easy; embrace your body.‚ÄùOur society is in an over-intellectualization crisis. We try too hard to think our way through things and wind up with mental health problems because our thinking does little to help our realities. The stuffing of our thinking is poking out worn seams, and our natural instinct to fix it is to work at it more,thinkeven harder. Many only know to solve things by applying sincerity as brute force.Thanks for reading spencer's paradoxes! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.SubscribeI had a conversation recently about cities can be characterized by whether people are in their heads or in their bodies. San Francisco is a city of head people. Miami is a city of body people. New York is a city of head people that transform into body people at night, modern-day werewolves.It‚Äôs fitting that I live in San Francisco normally because I love to be in my head, creating maps and dreams that I can, for a short period, convince myself is reality and avoiding the, sometimes artificially-rendered, hard problems in my life.Excusing myself from things that I no longer find joy in feels like navigating a minefield. Saying no to event invites I don‚Äôt care for still feels like betrayal. I struggle with being unflinching in my taste. I put a lot of pressure on therightway to do things, as perceived by others. I'm frightened by lingering gazes because I worry about being rude. I clam up talking to my idols and role models because I want to live up to their ideals. I feel the need to suppress my curiosity in public to avoid making a scene. I become a different person: tense, hyper-analytical, self-questioning.My survival instinct has been trained to prioritize propriety over my self-interest. I want to act like I'm in Miami all the time. Embrace my primal carnality.My mom loves to tell me that she is one of those people that operates really well under pressure. I suppose those genes of her ended up recessive in me. I need to prepare to feel comfortable. I manufacture my confidence. I choose my words carefully, delicate marbles plucked from a glass case. I wish I could yelp with joy like I can‚Äôt contain myself. I wish I could choose to crumple, like a trust fall or a scene that involves tripping, instead of being forced to the ground in a chokehold.Sometimes I wonder about people's first impressions of me. On a good day, if you catch me in the right environment (a small group, some prior context, an exciting topic has perked my interest), I'm sure people see someone warm, prone-to-laughing, curious. In a word, some might saycharismatic. On a bad day, in the wrong environment (high-pressure crowd, little context, a charged topic), I wonder if people just see a smiling head nodding or if they see through to the flesh crawling with hesitation and anxiety underneath,I'm someone who worries a lot. I worry about getting food made with love. I worry when I buy clothes that they'll match my hope of expressions. I worry about my relationship with dating, my attachment styles, my insecurities with emotional honesty. I worry about finding public bathrooms, about drinking too much water in the void of knowing, when discretely peeing in public for the sake of my bladder. I worry about how people perceive me, strangers and peers, and mentors and internet visitors. I worry about my physical needs. I worry about being seen biting my nails, shaking my legs, always choosing flight over fight. I worry about the 1-minute small talk with the barista at the cafe, about performing the proper rituals of eye contact exchange with the cute girl in the lobby, about staring too long at how people use their phones. I monitor for excessive ‚Äúalso‚Äùs and exclamation marks and worry about the demanding nature of ‚Äújust‚Äù in my texts. I worry about coming across as perfect. Beyond perfect, I worry about looking infallible.If you made a careful incision along my side, extracted my heart and opened it up like an omelet unfolding over omurice, you'd find a compressed seed that contains my deepest core desire.It's the desire to be fearless.To dive downhill, skis at a right angle, without a second thought. To be reckless. To say what I feel whenever I feel it. To meet intense gazes and hold them. To eliminate cringing. I've jokingly said I wish I could "dumb myself down," like a switch that turns off my mental propriety guard.But as much as I may think I desire that, I don‚Äôt really want that. The insecurity we share is what makes us human. Cringing is useful individually, too. It points to what you find embarrassing and improper. Signals forchoosingwhether to run away or towards. I don't want to relinquish any knowledge or part of myself in order to get unstuck.I want to become more ‚Äúunhinged.‚ÄùLetting myself move naturally, rather than respecting the rigid constraints of civilization. Practicing protest for my values, especially when they are in conflict with the broader world.Jamie and I recently talked about two kinds of fear: one is being afraid of something that doesn‚Äôt align with your true desires and the other is just being scared of something that‚Äôs hard. Having the discernment to distinguish the two and the courage to listen to the first and move past the second is maturity.We try to put up all these barriers to represent the way things are supposed to be when we could just.. not. Our fears aren‚Äôt as scary as we make them out to be. And we aren‚Äôt as stiff as we think ourselves to be. As long as we give ourselves permission to feel the freedom. The one that lets us loosen our fears, relax the whitening knuckles clinging on for dear life, terrified of what happens at the end of the ride.Of course, this is all mostly thinking, and it‚Äôs easier said than done. I‚Äôll be starting small, moving consistently. Unscrew a few nails here: trust myself to talk with charm to beautiful people. Untie a few knots there: follow my first instinct for taking space instead of questioning. Loosen the hinges a bit‚Äîand maybe I‚Äôll discover I can move in ways I never imagined.some other life updatesnew project:I‚Äôm working on a project that I‚Äôm currently callingtiny internetsthis summer. It‚Äôs an experiential research project exploring how we experience and find intimacy with strangers and how we feel safe expressing ourselves in meaningful ways on the internet.

      <title>punctuated by wonder</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/punctuated-by-wonder</link>
      <description>some moments from new york in my ‚Äúphoto a day‚Äù album. from left to right 1) a dead spotted lanternfly that we killed bc apparently they are an invading pest 2) friend‚Äôs surprise birthday party with terrifying cutouts of their face 3) an exit sign procured from a magical space 4) a doll that was the container for the bill 5) the patterns in a fun ice holder 6) i thought this was a trash can with a mirror, turns out it was just a dresser someone was throwing out.Last night, M asked me about rose, thorn, bud about my time in New York this time around as it comes to an end. My natural expectation for a rose is something big, meaningful, big announcement and showers of confetti, so it was surprisingly wonderful to observe myself go towards the smallest things: a timeline of smiles, an army of carriage drivers hustling for rides after a show, playground fountains like secret geysers, the moon in all her sizes peeking out above the trees, rising like a star over Brooklyn Museum, a ring of statues of old, famed philosophers along the roof casting long shadows.These small moments are what I live for. I used to crave the satisfaction that would come from finishing big, professional Goals: securing a good internship, moving into the right neighborhood, going on the perfect trip or restaurant, finding the right startup job. A lot of these things don‚Äôt end up living up to expectations when you end up getting them. We expect that our lives will magically improve by many multiples, but we just have one more accomplishment or bucket list item checked off of our list and life goes on. Things that suck still suck. On the flip side, things that are wonderful are still wonderful.I wonder at what point I started appreciating tiny moments more, when I learned to stop putting so much pressure on things that seemed important and nourishing. I see little threads of it in the occasional poem I wrote right after college, likea twinkle,inspired by a summer stint in Taiwan. A significant part definitely came from loosening my tendency to need to rush everywhere I went, impatiently optimizing every single moment of my life for productivity. First for video games, maximizing my hours of practice, and then for ‚Äúwork.‚Äù I started meandering around instead of speed-walking to specific destinations. I began to let my mind go on disparate rabbit holes, jumping between dance videos and poems and cooking vlogs. I disassociated myself from needing to be legible to anyone externally watching and trying to make sense of my machinations. When I learned to follow my instinct for what gives me unexpected joy, when I opened myself up to receiving a bit more of the breadth of detail in everyday reality, when I gave up on any notion of a universal standard for meaningfulness, I started finding wonder in the most unexpected of places, in everyday moments.I hope my life always feels like a series of moments punctuated by wonder. I hope I never lose the joy I get from discovering the moon peeking out in an innocuous patch of sky. I hope I‚Äôll never lose my tendency to stop in the middle of walks for the silliest things: a CCTV camera that appears to be sprouting from vines, a whale-shaped cloud, the eyes-closed, lips pursed, pure bliss of a car passenger jamming to a song. The face of one in rapture, free of judgment, open with no assumptions, eager for any surprise that life offers so willingly.Thanks for reading spencer's paradoxes!

      <title>making hard things easy</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/making-hard-things-easy</link>
      <description>Hayao Miyazaki taking a break from creative blocks in his garden (from thisfantastic thread)When I feel overwhelmed, my usual coping mechanism is to retreat into my personal routines, practices where I feel invisible, where I can meld into the world around me, feel as if I'm a part of the all-powerful universe rather than my so limited self. Iced coffee, outdoor table, reading. Biking around the park at night, fireflies and the moon lighting the way. I let my identity sink deep down and let my surroundings consume me.I‚Äôve been thinking about how life is just an exercise in making hard things easy. A related thought is how the most true ideas are cliches‚Äîyou just have to learn at a bodily level rather than an intellectual level for it to embed into the fabric of your being. Ava says thatunderstanding is rare, so you only need a few ideas that are exceptionally clear to you. All that‚Äôs left, if you care about it, is to convince others of those ideas at the same level as you.Understanding, even shallow, is rare to me. I learn slowly. Every new fact or statement yields five more questions, a terrifying hydra of question marks. I've never done something for the first time where I've felt like a natural at it. I have negligible hand-eye coordination, so every sport I pick up it takes me a long time to get to a decent place. This applies to very precise crafts too. Sewing is herculean. Don't let me fold paper; it will come out curved like a fish‚Äôs bone. When a shopkeeper in Japan taught my friends and I how to do a simple origami crane, I distinctly remember him making a joke about how I should maybe not go into origami. That didn't stop me from buying origami paper aspirationally (and then proceeding to never use it).What I lack in talent, I make up for in work. I just do it over and over and over again until some small part of it starts to feel easy. With dance, I embarrassed myself over and over again going to beginner dance classes with absolutely no rhythm. With coding, I feel an urge to rewrite and refactor until it feels right. With writing, I would physically cringe reading the Medium essays I was posting in college and sending to my friends.Embarrassing myself is at least the narrative I tell in my head, but in reality, no one who matters to you cares when you‚Äôre working on something in this way. In every single one of my pursuits, hobbies, passions, etc., this is the feeling my forward momentum gets caught by. I hold a double standard for myself. I‚Äôll encourage every friend who even mentions the idea of writing more while running away from the voice in my head that asks ‚Äúwhat are you even putting on this page.‚Äù I love how people post random parts of their lives on social media because they are a surprisingly intimate lens into what they find wonder in in everyday life, but I‚Äôll second-guess my picture of a cloud or the alleyway or the moon peeking out the corner apartment, wondering ‚Äúis this dumb?‚Äù I love being there for someone to lean on and be comforted by when times are rough, but when I really need a hug or show of affection I‚Äôll hide my pain because I don‚Äôt want to be a burden.At a certain point of progression, I reach an equilibrium where I know exactly what I need to do to get to my goal, yet my natural second-guessing will stop me. I‚Äôve always really admired the people who will just dive head-first into something that scares them over and over again without reservation and have often tried to force myself to do this in sprints of suffering. However, having recently consumed more content aroundshadow work, I think the path to sustainable resolution of heightened inner dissonance is actually integrating the parts of yourself that you hide in shame.Rather than trying hard at doing the hard things, I‚Äôve been thinking about what it takes to just do things that feel easy (or make the hard things easy). It‚Äôs a philosophy where you don‚Äôtforceyourself to do anything. Instead, the directive is to be natural, follow the flow of energy in each moment. I don‚Äôt want to toil away at things that stay hard, especially not ones that are out of my control, because you might end up going the opposite direction.For example, when I‚Äôve become obsessed with an archetype that feels hard to identify as, I try really hard to acquire theaestheticof ‚Äúsomeone who does X‚Äù rather than actuallybeingthat person. I wanted to become someone who loved creating things, so I made a bunch of side projects in college that had no meaning to me. I worked off machine learning tutorials and built todo list apps using the hottest new frameworks to show I had madesomethingrather than showing my own world. After college, that urge emerged naturally, and I found boundless joy in creatingpoetic softwareandparticipatory websites. Those artifacts were much easier to create and simultaneously muchbetterin absolute terms because they had soul behind them.If things feel hard, there‚Äôs some part that is inherently wrong. It might be that your current mental state isn‚Äôt compatible, or your subconscious has picked up on something jarring. If you just listen to your body and follow the path of least resistance, what will you find? When you meet a blocked path, what if you meander a different path rather than plowing through? Wander a bit, keeping your eyes open, and you might just find a shortcut to your destination.Thanks for reading spencer's paradoxes!

      <title>realizations &amp; transformative moments</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/realizations-and-transformative-moments</link>
      <description>These past couple of months have been fruitful for realizations. They were simple‚Äîmost likely things my subconscious has always known but never accepted. Here‚Äôs a list for reminding myself of the truths that matter.One. For a long time, I thought the issues I struggle with most were common to everyone. I thought I failed to overcome them in my early age, that I needed to ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù to how others had adapted. I thought social anxiety was something that came with the territory of being an introvert. I assumed others who liked to be alone did so out of necessity rather than mere preference, an escape from the overwhelming pressure of crowds. I thought it was normal to have moments where alarm steals your ability to breathe and think. At some level, I knew that things were wrong, but I had normalized my experience of being different. Being overwhelmed with the feeling of judgment by new people, prospective partners, attractive strangers, and respected mentors was an everyday experience. I suspect that's where my naturally anxious personality comes from. I'm most afraid, most tensed, most uncomfortable approaching the people that I'm drawn to. I realize now that this isn‚Äôt common. I‚Äôm trying to view the tension as my body telling me that I care. Dispelling the notion that I need to catch up, I have the space to be at peace with this behavior, to make space for myself, to let go of the pressure to ‚Äúnormalize‚Äù myself.Two. At the same time, some part of me has always resented and been ashamed of these struggles. They kept me from opening up about my troubles. It was easier to pretend I was perfectly fine, to shroud my insecurities behind an enigmatic, nonchalant exterior. As a kid, I obsessed over ninjas and powerful mystics in cloaks and all-powerful geniuses who never had to try to get what they wanted. I‚Äôm uncomfortable with how accommodating I am, how I put complete strangers above my own happiness and desires, how I suppress my natural curiosities and imaginations and honest opinions for some notion of propriety or external sense of rightness. I wear my shame with a seething pride. It's my excuse for my struggles, a badge of pain and hardship. I don't have to take any real risk because I have this out. I realize now that I take so much for granted. How I chase my natural curiosities‚Äîmy self-investigative essays and experimental weaving of code towards some digital beauty. I talked to C recently, and she recounted how her brain is empty whenever she has idle moments, that she wanted to want to do more passionate things in her free time. I naturally fall into spending my time on truly passionate and fulfilling endeavors. My discipline with being "proper" means I'm exceptionally capable of designing and enacting rituals to try out a new craft. My clinical-level observation skills make me capable of gifting the sensation of comfort. Accepting your ‚Äúweaknesses‚Äù and shames and considering them in the light of what they empower you to do is grounding. It‚Äôs a gratitude exercise to ground you in who you are rather than some ‚ÄúOther‚Äù you‚Äôre trying to emulate.Three. The most transformative moments in life come from risks that don't seem worth it. They‚Äôre ones that seem either too innocuous to matter or too high stakes to be worth the cost. I have a pretty poor memory, but the things that do stick with me are all the little moments where I‚Äôve felt a spontaneous urge and passed it over. Whether it‚Äôs engaging with a street performer, complimenting a stranger on their outfit, pressing a friend on a point of conflict, dancing in the street, expressing words of love, or allowing my eyes to wander and linger on authentic sparks of curiosity, some notion of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù gets in the way of my natural interest. In these moments, I need a reminder of the magical, unbelievable good that has come out of when I have managed to make the leap. An exchange of typewriter poems after a 4-hour conversation with a stranger in a park. A sustained bond with the owners of the cutest Vietnamese cafe in East Village (Le Phin btw, they have great drinks). A genuine smile from a friend. A relationship strengthened by the steel of honesty. The exchange of knowing glances. The jubilance of the air twirling alongside your limbs. Those split-second moments where you‚Äôre cradling the universe in your soft, calloused hands, and a tiny jolt scales your fingertips as miracles are exchanged.updatesI presented my tiny internets project, an exploration into internet intimacy and how we create spaces on the web for ourselves, at a presentation, more to come on this! in the meantime, enjoy this great photo Katherine tookkatherine (boston era)@bookwormgirl910spencer :'))

      <title>finding ground</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/finding-ground</link>
      <description>I love sitting in the window seat while flying so much (probably somewhere over Arizona I wanna say?)I‚Äôve been going nonstop lately. This is unusual for me because I like to take things slowly, revel in the space between moments. I‚Äôve noticed that I increasingly feel rushed. Time feels like grains of sand slipping between my fingers, as if I‚Äôm perpetually late. I notice it in the way I walk, how strolls turn into brisk walks. I notice it in the way I think, how daydreaming has become stressful, efficient logistics sorting. While I can appreciate my survival instinct to adapt to high-stress environments, I don‚Äôt want this version to stay for too long. I fear I might lose the part of myself that knows how to slow down.I‚Äôm restless because I‚Äôm not sure I trust myself to surviveanywhere. I‚Äôm scared I can only thrive in niche, limited environment. Places where I have the privilege to enjoy the aesthetic of things and chase my newest passion without worrying about survival. I‚Äôve been able to embrace a very childlike lifestyle lately. I optimized my life for being able to play without consequence by either transforming or avoiding normally taxing ‚Äúadult‚Äù responsibilities. Cooking became a field for creative experimentation and art for the tongue. Washing dishes became a welcome mental break. Getting toilet paper, talking to Xfinity support, and coordinating PG&amp;E was conveniently handled by my roommates.Thanks for reading spencer's paradoxes! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.SubscribeI‚Äôve cultivated an ability over time toneedto do very little work I find draining. I worry that I‚Äôve gotten too good. That if (or when) a time comes where I need to handle it all on my own, I‚Äôd be crushed under the weight of a million tiny responsibilities. The problem is that I‚Äôm a perfectionist. I‚Äôll feel the urge to do these small tasks with every ounce of my being, which burns me out for everything else important.I don‚Äôt wantcaring too muchto be a problem. I know people say that to embrace self-love you have to set boundaries and learn to not care, but what if I just want to find a way to increase my capacity to care? What if I want to be able to dedicate every fiber in my body to doing laundry or cleaning the window, or taking the trash out?After the residency I did this summer, a nucleus and lifestyle that gave me almost no time to stop and think, let alone process what was happening in my life, I‚Äôve returned to an unfamiliar flavor of my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life. Familiar objects misplaced or disappeared. Second nature routines now awkward and clumsy. Part of me feels like I‚Äôm in the sidelines, watching all of life happen.For the past couple years, I was satisfied. I felt whole. I felt grounded no matter what I did. IknewI did well at my job. IknewI did well at my craft. IknewI lived in a nice and affordable home, that I had a personalized space to welcome people into. IknewI had people I could rely on if trouble came around or if I needed someone to listen to me rant.My life was stable, and I could guess with pretty high accuracy what the next few months would bring me‚Äîmore fun trips, group movies, morning bike rides into the fog with an Arsicault croissant waiting at the end.I was happy to experience life. I still feel grateful for every experience, but I‚Äôve lost that spark of wonder in recent weeks. Want has consumed me. I‚Äôve had a taste of a drastically different life, and it‚Äôs enough to dive into a new ocean and see where I turn up.For the past couple years, I‚Äôve been steadily doing all the things I want and love: developing my taste, creating meaningful artifacts, and cultivating lasting relationships. But I think it‚Äôs easy to become settled in a life that fools you into thinking it‚Äôs iterative, when you‚Äôve started to grow stagnant. And it‚Äôs probably better to jump when you‚Äôre at the top of your game, before you lose the momentum of what‚Äôs grounding you to take it into a new adventure.I told myself I lived my dream life. And in a lot of ways, I did. What kind of privilege is it to be able to have dreams and actually work towards them? To be paid to make things that people love and live in a beautiful home nested in a beautiful land.Yet here I am writing furiously into my iPad on a Thursday night with a knot in my stomach I attempt to appease with creative cocktails and garlic shrimp chips.Something isn‚Äôt working is how it feels. Something needs to change.I need to know what I wouldchoosein the absence of anything. I need to pull off aconfidence trick, claw myself out of a hole I dig. I need to destroy myself and listen to what naturally emerges. In the way mushrooms sprout spontaneously after rain, I want to see what sprouts in me and nurture it to its natural resting place.Big changes, or disasters, are useful in forcing you to make a lot of drastic choices explicitly. There‚Äôs a reason we call disasters cataclysmic. Destruction offers space for reconstruction.Wounds offer space for regeneration. Apocalypse offers the chance at an alternative reality.As much as I talk about embracing destabilizing change, I still wonder if I‚Äôm too fragile to survive. I avoid pain and suffering as much as I can. I wiggle out of responsibility and logistical overhead. I find the path of least resistance and sneak along the bushes.I imagine drifting in a moonless ocean. It‚Äôs dark. All I can feel is the water lapping against the edges of my body. No waves. No gulls. Nothing but the steady parting and rejoining of the water. I‚Äôm floating. But for how long? Will I sink slowly, painstaking inch by painstaking inch, or will I learn how to swim?I‚Äôve been told my superpowers are ‚Äúresilience, consistency, and optimism,‚Äù and it‚Äôs true that I have a tendency tobang my head against thingsunder I figure out how to do them. So maybe it‚Äôs time to trust myself to learn how to swim when it really comes to matter.I‚Äôll swim. Towards some fantasy shore. Even if the horizon never changes. I‚Äôll just keep going. There‚Äôs so much out there. A horizon imbued with promise, full of things to discover and appreciate. So much magic to work with for buildingportals for intimacy.I‚Äôll jump and imagine a different alternative, to dive deep, lungs bursting at the seams, and when I surface, I‚Äôll explore the new land I find.Thanks for reading spencer's paradoxes!

      <title>give fiercely, spend freely</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/give-fiercely-spend-freely</link>
      <description>Ocean Parkby Robert Irwin‚ÄúPurity does not lie in separation from but in deeper penetration into the universe‚Äù ‚Äî Teilhard de Chardin.I just readThe Writing Lifeby Anne Dillard (thanks to Jacky for the rec), which ends with this quote. The book is a wonderful collection of segments, journal-like entries, and small meditations on the life of one who writes: the sleepless nights and uninspired days along with those moments of sudden, vicious grace.I‚Äôm wrapping up a two-week vacation with my family, which felt much-needed after a hectic August of moving, work, and life prospecting. I was experiencing adampening of curiosity, following a whirlwind summer of exciting projects, from a participatory art exhibit to a research prototype for a tinier, cozier, more personal internet (more to share soon now), and general life upheaval (living in a new city, figuring out what I want in a relationship and where I want to spend my time among my many interests).I felt a nagging pressure to be productive. There were so many things I wanted to do that now felt like chores. Iwantedto do them, but it felt more like Ihadto do them whenever I had a chance. I was scrambling between different tasks, a million decisions like invisible paper cuts weighing me down. It felt like I had no time to do the things I wanted to do, or in the little time I had, the minutes slid away as I dragged my uncooperative mind along. It felt like trying to mix oil and vinegar with a plastic fork. Whisking on and on, more motion than substance.I‚Äôm trying to admire the inscriptions on trees, tiny mountain ranges in bark, but he won‚Äôt leave me alone. On my shoulder a little man in a business suit droning into my ear.Write that post. Finish that brief. Make that prototype.I‚Äôve lost the path in my journey, so I plunged myself into the wilderness and stopped trying to get back on track.When I come up with an idea, I often feel the urge to save them for a later time. When the timing is better. When I have more energy. When it‚Äôs more likely for the idea to be successful.I‚Äôm a saver by nature. It stems from my relationship with money, where I‚Äôm hyper-conscious about value. I‚Äôll almost always opt for public transport or taking a bike rather than using a ridesharing app, sell friends on sharing appetizers, choose bulk products for the bargain. This philosophy extends my hoarding tendencies. My ideas are my mental trinkets and old pieces of clothing, imbued with history and meaning, collecting dust and cobwebs in the corner of my mind. I feel an urge to save them for later, where they can come fully to life. While I love my passion for not leaving any waste and extracting creative uses from leftovers (both food and other random material objects), it becomes toxic when you never use anything or always have a decaying saved backlog.Dillard implores against this frugality and urges us to spend and give more liberally:One of the few things I know about writing is this: spend it all, shoot it, play it, lose it, all, right away, every time. Do not hoard what seems good for a later place in the book, or for another book; give it, give it all, give it now. The impulse to save something good for a better place later is the signal to spend it now. Something more will arise for later, something better. These things fill from behind, from beneath, like well water. Similarly, the impulse to keep to yourself what you have learned is not only shameful, it is destructive. Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find ashes.I think this applies beyond writing life to any creative endeavor as well as our interactions with others.Along with working onasserting my own needs better, without shame, I‚Äôve been working on giving fiercely and spending freely.I remember being stingy with my time growing up. My schedule was optimized for maximal efficiency, the most hours spent doing the things I wanted to do. Doing the things I needed to do (that didn‚Äôt overlap with the former) in the least amount of time possible. It meant leaving the house for lunch with my family on the weekend felt like a chore sometimes. I was also picky about helping others. I mostly did it when I felt like there was something in it for me, or if the actual work involved exercised the right parts of the brain. Manual labor felt like a terrible waste of time. I wanted to stick to the schedule that accomplished exactly what I wanted and needed to do.My stinginess towards giving reflected my stinginess towards saving. I wanted to save things for the last moment. I don‚Äôt think I really wanted to spend them at all, in reality. What I was seeking was the comfort of knowing I had this contingency stash. I wanted to savor theideaof having the thing rather than the thing itself. Whenever I get ramen, I used to always save the ramen egg for last because it‚Äôs my favorite part. At the end I would often be too full to really enjoy it. In my saving I was corrupting what I loved, ruining my enjoyment of them. Robert Irwin is said to practice a philosophy of ‚Äúlavish needs, modestly met,‚Äù which seems appropriate for embracing your very specific taste for food, aesthetics, behavior, and more. Enjoy them whenever possible, meet them as well as you can while understanding the constraints of your active situation.The times I‚Äôve felt the best giving a gift have been the ones given completely freely. No weird strings of obligation. No questioning of value. They feel like they emerged naturally. Isaw or made something because I thought of you. That‚Äôs all.It‚Äôs the same for my best acts of spending. The pants IknewI would love, but was always outside my price range. A passion project that‚Äôs been stewing for two years but never felt appropriate timing-wise. The experience of a lifetime that collided with many other commitments. Something in your body gives you the space for these things. We should get better at listening when it does.I think we try to hoard and save things for later because we don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre worthy of greatness now and we‚Äôre hedging for bad situation in the future. The goal is to maintain a minimum level of satisfaction, so we think, we feel fine now, why don‚Äôt we save that for a rainy day. We end up never using our saved potions, or when we do want to use they no longer give the same satisfaction we thought they would. We do it mostly for theactof saving, an insurance policy against feeling bad. This is a valid way to live, but it doesn‚Äôt make sense if your goal is toexperience it all, the full spectrum of life in every moment.Instead of avoidingfeeling bad, what if we always sought fuller experience?I want to feel the same towards the work I do. I never want to feel like I‚Äôm inhibited from expression because of the desire to save something for later. I want to lean fully into the surfacing energy and ride it as far as I can. Becoming a vessel for the idea and expression.Every time we encounter the world, we give a piece of ourselves away. More precisely, we leave a piece of ourselves in the world, a mark of our presence. Many animals mark their territory by peeing along the boundary. Humans mark their territory by interacting with the world: a greeting here, a smile there, a footprint in a misty trail. But it‚Äôs not a one-way trade. Weexchange ourselves for a connection with the universe. We give threads of ourselves to the world and in return, we receive strands of the infinite universe surrounding us.Expressing yourself fully is an act of faith. It‚Äôs a crazy thing, really. You must believe that natural laws don‚Äôt apply to you. There is no room for logical thinking‚Äîit only gets you caught up in your own mental obstacles. You must believe that energy is limitless, that you can produce it again and again, ride a loop around the sun, skim your wings across the tongues of flames, and live to do it again.So, spend it all, give it away. Let your heart loose, free your lungs, open your eyes and breathe it all in. Release your joints and limbs and dance likestophas no meaning. Live in a world wherewaitis illogical. Seize energy by the horns and ride the riptide. Row the same direction, consistently, constantly, regardless of how the current changes. Burn into the good night, through the fuel for the return journey. Participate. Play the game like you‚Äôre trying to win now. And then do it again and again.Gambleit all on yourself. Right now, in this very moment. Act like you‚Äôre worthy of the entire universe. Because we are. Because we‚Äôre here. So we‚Äôll always have the ability to play. There‚Äôs no time to waste.thanks toArifor sharing this wonderful poem with me :)updateshomebase:As I figure out where I want to settle for the next couple years, I moved to Oakland since my SF lease ended.

      <title>the little moments are what we live for</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/the-little-moments-are-what-we-live</link>
      <description>Often I find it exceptionally uncomfortable to inhabit a state of absolutes. Yet in those rare moments when it doesn't feel like that, I feel limitless. Like I am in perfect harmony with the world.This manifests in my difficulty in feeling completely right about something. The little things especially. Where I want to go eat. What I want to go do. I say I want spontaneity but in reality, my moves are controlled by hidden calculations and the obsessive need topreparethe right kind of environment to enjoy spontaneity. Sure, I talk to strangers on my daily walks, and I'll strike up a conversation to figure out when someone is doing something interesting. But that doesn't mean I don't have a million threads in my head, tensing me for every possible situation, reciting the right words, searching for the right phrases.I'm in an endless search for the recipe for perfection. I'm seeking a world that goes exactly how I want. In doing so, what I really want is to be stripped of my freedom. I don't want to have tochooseanything. My preparations are really sheer substitutes for how I think Ishouldbe choosing rather than what I really want. When you give me too long to prepare for things, myshouldmind gets in the way of my heart. I start hiding my true passions, caveating my true desires, releasing forceful opinions.Things either feel right or they don't. There is no in-between. Despite knowing this, I struggle with self-doubt. I hem and haw my way out of strong emotions.The date was fine but maybe I just wasn't feeling it. -&gt; translation: interesting conversation was nowhere to be found.He's not the best at emotional safety-&gt; translation: I dread their feedback on my work.I‚Äôm good‚Üí translation: there are a million open threads in my life right now and I‚Äôm trying to find space to find ground.When this happens, it‚Äôs useful to bring myself to a space of play and abundance. I go to my regular sources ofwonderand feel for the worn grooves of genuine curiosity.When everything feelsright,I always have to remind myself to sit with the energy for a bit rather than trying to consume it all at once. I want to brand my soul with that emotional state, tattoo it into the fabric of my being, scoop it up into the special shoebox I keep in the corner of my heart's attic for those days when the windows are all dark and the sun is nowhere to be found and it feels like everything you do won't stick, and that ephemerality, the fleeting nature of life, doesn‚Äôt evoke beauty; it breaks your heart. For those days, especially, when you're trying, desperately, to put part of yourself into the world, to show that you matter, even if it's just a simple mark on a tree in a forest that no one else will visit or whispering a word that no one else will hear. To know, just for yourself, that you can create change and cause effect, that it will last for a brief moment in this insignificant blip of a life.a mundane moment of wonder recently in my life. Look at the way these bubbles sit on the cup. It‚Äôs like a pattern of ice, like suspended belief made physical. And when you set the cup down firmly, a flock of them takes off, little raindrops moving in reverse.People spend all their lives stressed about the big decisions in life: where to work, how to identify themselves, who to spend their lives with. We're told to prepare for the Big Questions, that they'll determine the rest of our lives. Ruin them if we aren't careful.But the moments when I feel most right are the most mundane. I find them in the small windows of blinding sunset through downtown streets. I find them in the whisper of the wind through trees. If I stay long enough, I can see them swaying, a secret dance with the breeze. The moments that matter are when a smile lingers, the cushion of silence in the space between topics, a small touch of the hand or a laugh like a black hole sucking the tension right out of your rigid bones.How can I experience this and even pretend to believe, let alone act, that the Big Questions are the ones that matter? The feeling inscribed in my bones says that these tiny moments are what we live for, what we'remade for. Our purpose is to exist for these moments. To see them and feel them, attend to the world and its inhabitants in all their infinite detail.I hope we always treasure these small moments. Every time I find myself lost in the search for perfection, this is one thing that always feels right. Always feels resonant and good and necessary. And the world needs us just as much as we need it. So go on and do your duty. The world depends on it.SubscribeP.S.A few years ago I aspirationally wanted to do this series of short stories imagining fantastical alternatives to these sorts of mundane moments. I made a few: one about alight in a dark room, another about asnowy car drive, and a final one abouta midnight stroll. If you find these interesting, let me know! I have the energy for this sort of thing again, although they might manifest as poems instead...P.P.SI‚Äôm releasing a little net art project in this vein. It‚Äôs a window into these tiny moments of my life that stand out to me, at least make enough of an impact that I take a picture of them. I would love to know how it makes you feel! I am testing the waters for making this a more regular practice. You can find it athttps://www.spencerchang.me/window/more life updatesI realize I had a typo in my last email which conveniently omitted the exact place I was saying I was moving to, so no I didn‚Äôt move to some blank purgatory, but I‚Äôm in Oakland now on a short-term sublease, working out some logistics for an aspirational move to Brooklyn.I have been pretty casual with updating this newsletter ever since I finished my100 mini essays, but I want to commit to a more regular post schedule now! I‚Äôll be starting with weekly, so expect to see a post at the end of every week :) Let me know if there‚Äôs anything you would find interesting</description>

      <title>reminders when worrying about whats next</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/reminders-when-worrying-about-whats</link>
      <description>I hate the mindset I‚Äôm stuck in right now: always thinking about the next thing, worrying about what‚Äôs to come, comparing plans and evaluating paths like an open-world build-your-own-adventure game where you can only compare plans, never build anything. I love being with people who make you feel like time isn‚Äôt real, where you‚Äôre so immersed in the moment of life that the future and the past are enchanted too. I‚Äôm a believer that you can plan all you want for the future, but you‚Äôll never know what will happen or how you will act.It‚Äôs the same with learning. You can read all you want and be told all day how youshoulddo something, but it‚Äôll never stick. Worse, reading about something may give you premature gratification and trick you into thinking you already put in the work. You have to actually do it, see how it‚Äôs wrong, adjust. Trial and error. Making and perceiving. Over and over until a way feels right to you. Becomes your way, a practice embedded into your very bones. You start feeling how ideas take shape the moment they appear because you‚Äôve done it before. You start weaving life from wisps of thought.I‚Äôm looking at my ceiling again. One of those Instagram-ad, flimsy sunset lamps spotlights the corner. A little Pink at the center of a yellowing Orange. A halo of glossy red, like rings of compressed fire. A sun ate a peach and we're looking at the x-ray. The peach spotlights the normally invisible blotches and moles of the ceiling. They don‚Äôt make makeup for ceilings. They aren't meant to be looked at for too long, least of all with such an intense gaze, searching for some soul in speckled plaster. They‚Äôre designed to provide inherent safety. To be invisible to the point that no one ever thinks about the miracle of being sheltered from the elements.I'm looking up as if the answers are to be found in the air hanging above me. As if some god will place them there for me, lower ambrosia from the heavens straight into my hungering mouth. As if I deserve to be great, as if I'm entitled to greatness.Here‚Äôs what I know at this point. I want to create life. I want to make things that are useful, beautiful, ubiquitous. I want to make relationships that seem like logical fallacies: comforting but challenging, constant but alwaystransforming, expanding, converging and diverging like an infinity symbol. I want to spend my life energy on greatness, in the sense that they should feel like the most important thing in the moment. They should feel less like desires and more like essential duties and rights. I want to treatevery momentI experience as one that inspires me tospend all of myself, discard all my ingrained obsessions with frugality.a slice of my notebook from a year ago thinking about this same questionI still see Pink when I close my eyes. A tiny dot. A faint glow in the corner of my mind. It's a reminder that things will stay as they seem. That even when you're stuck in places you don't want to be. Even when it feels like all the purpose driving you has hidden itself like your keys when you're leaving the house. Even and especially when you start to question your purpose and what you get up every day to do. The world can surprise you. The world will surprise you.And wouldn't it be a shame to turn away? To shut your eyes? To worry. Constantly. About what's next, what's best, what's fast, what's right. Stress til your stomach is overflowing with butterflies and there's no room for flying let alone breathing. We lose our breath when we try to think too hard about breathing. We lose our way when we try too hard at choosing it. Purpose comes and goes, but the way is always with us. We just have to stay with it. Follow the energy flowing through every day. Make the small, crucial nudges. Put our faith in ourselves and the universe and our uncanny ability to always find something interesting.from Le Guin‚Äôs translation of Tao Te ChingThanks for reading spencer's paradoxes!

      <title>life of a romantic</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/life-of-a-romantic</link>
      <description>a still fromThe Wind Rises, a Miyazaki film about a romantic engineerIf you grabbed me by the nape and started rolling me up, the way one folds a collapsible picnic blanket. That is to say, with difficulty getting the right angles, tucking in stray bits, and eliminating air pockets so that it fits into a neat shape that fits reasonably into a bag for taking home. But if you managed to do it successfully at some point, and distilled my rolled-up form into a single word, I imagine you‚Äôd fine ‚Äúromantic‚Äù after the dust of the operation settles.I‚Äôm a romantic at heart, in every sense of the word.Thanks for reading spencer's paradoxes! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.SubscribeI believe there‚Äôs endless hope in the world. I believe in optimism, that it‚Äôs always a choice and always the right one. I fall in love easily. I get absorbed, wisps of my essence sneaking out my extremities, seeking an adventure in a new home. I dilute myself with the world. Get swept up in the waves of a starlit city, the glint of universe in their eye, how late sunlight drapes her body in gold between these worn cypresses, how a single word can make your heart feel like it burst at the seams, how a simple flow to a melody can sew up the rips in an instant.I become obsessed. I‚Äôm obsessed with losing myself in new worlds. I lose my breath when I see someone dance with abandon. I‚Äôm wrapped in awe when I hear someone talk with divine faith in the importance of what they do. I cry streams in those stupid little moments, when‚Äîfrom my particular vantage point‚Äîthe atoms of the universe line up and this second feels sufficient as a reason for why we were given breath in the first place.This sounds nice and fluffy, but my romantic tendencies have a double edge, too. It means whenever I don‚Äôt get what I‚Äôm hoping for or expecting, I feel every bit of the pain that it triggers. I can‚Äôt put it under a box or shove it into the attic or hide it under the carpet. I don‚Äôt have the capacity to turn off my receptors. My stomach capsizes when I feel like I‚Äôm disappointing someone. My mind overloads when I‚Äôm navigating the spectrum of resting states for new relationships.This is not to say that I hide from the pain. In fact, I run towards it; pain is yet another avenue for my obsession. I romanticize tragedy. So when say I go on a ‚Äúsecond date‚Äù that turns out to be something else, I pretend I‚Äôm a Romeo. I kick up gravel and spin it into a whirlwind of daggers and savor the overwhelming nature of a million invisible cuts. I love the energy that comes from intense emotion. Whenever I went through overwhelming troubles in college, I walked out into the field of trees by the campus gate at night, put on Labyrinth and Sam Smith and found a large oak‚Äôs shoulder to cry on. When a crush was unrequited, I biked across the city, listening to gnash and keshi, found a large bench in the middle of an empty park and danced under the stars until I felt once more connected to the world.There‚Äôs a rising sentiment that romance is dead‚Äîcorrupted by the technology age. Reborn as a multi-headed hydra with infinite optionality. Polyamory is a thriving community in major metropolitan cities. Having a ‚Äúrotation‚Äù of partners (intimate, sexual, and everything in between) is not only a norm but has become an expectation. If you‚Äôre single and opting out, a member of society can‚Äôt help but wonder ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong with them?‚ÄùAt the same time, people are more emotionally frustrated than ever before. People don‚Äôt thinkthey have as many close friends as we used to. Therapy has become a thriving industry, even while you see jokessuch as thisgo viral. There‚Äôs a societal sense that something is wrong. Yearning as opposed to satisfaction has become a norm. We feel as if we have to act satisfied; that if we don‚Äôt, we‚Äôll appear desperate, that no one wants to be around someone who has the stench of desperation, so we cover ourselves with social media packaged perfume and pretend that it‚Äôs business as usual, glamor is an everyday institution. All the while, the landfills are overflowing and the garbage is poking out the seams of our floorboards.I wonder if sometimes I‚Äôm too idealistic, if imagining film-perfect narratives is unhealthy for me. A small voice whispers ‚Äúshould I temper my dreams, fit them into more ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù boxes?‚Äù Of course, my mind roars back a resonant ‚ÄúNo." But still, that doesn‚Äôt stop me from the occasional wondering, peeking in that metaphorical closet of skeletons. Every time I feel overwhelming sensations, part of me wishes I was numbed to the extremes while another relishes every second of the rush.While I was in New York this summer, I took adance class by Bo Park. I did a little research beforehand and saw how hard the choreo she was teaching was, so I watched the choreo video and started prepping. I wanted to have fun, but also, I really wanted to look good doing it. It‚Äôs funny how the things I stress the most over often turn out to not be worth all the energy I invest in them. Of course, my antsy preparation before the class didn‚Äôt change how I did. It‚Äôs a fatal flaw that many dancers do, which Bo pointed out in class too: ‚ÄúStop doing extra practice. Look at yourself and have fun.‚ÄùEven though I know how much embracing what I want to do for its own sake would make me happy, I find it almost impossible to do. My need for excellence floods my muscles like cold air into a warm room through an ajar window. I have to always be wary, to acknowledge it and move past before it dilutes my every moment.I‚Äôve been trying to introspect on those moments of heightened awareness, when my emotions string themselves across my heart and take control of the ship from my mind, giving full freedom to my heart. I listen and watch, sitting quietly like the start of a movie.Why do I focus so much on appearing a certain way? Why do I need to control myself?What if I just took off all the filters standing between myself and the world? What if I let my romanticism out unchanged?At the end of all this searching and inspection, I‚Äôm grasping for a sense ofDeep Okaynessas Sasha writes. I know that I have immense inherent value. I know that I am enough. But I‚Äôm still learning to think and say both of those in a fully genuine way, not hiding any of my struggles, fears, and needs to not look desperate for presence, love, or understanding.Because I‚Äôm a romantic I believe that I can do anything I set my mind to, that the world can be shaped into a shape meant for me. But I‚Äôm also a fatalistic logician, which means I‚Äôll obsess over the one thing that could possibly go wrong and use it as a reason to avoid doing anything. I'm an optimist, which means I believe that everything will turn out ok even if I wing it. But I‚Äôm also a people pleaser, which means I‚Äôll stress¬†out about how I‚Äôm perceived and the effect it has on others in any situation unless I try to plan out every detail.I‚Äôm getting better at seeing all the ways that I am and seeing romanticism for all the strengths it gives me rather than feeling some need to hide or repress it for the sake of my external appearance. I want to wield it as my superpower, rather than a handicap.In the end, it‚Äôs fruitless to try to change because I don‚Äôt knowhowto act in any other way. I‚Äôll always romanticize my life, moment by moment, emotion by emotion, relationship by relationship. I‚Äôll learn every face of my heart. From unbounded pain, to a mischievous smile, to unstoppable laughter, I vow to never look away, cringe or cut myself off short. Dreaming is in my blood. Love is in my bones. Drama and narrativizing my life, even the little things, is as natural as breathing. Acting in service of everything I think is good and right is my evolutionary heritage; it‚Äôs how I learned to survive.‚ÄúLike you, I was born. Like you, I was raised in the institution of dreaming. Hand on my heart. Hand on my stupid heart.‚Äù ‚ÄîMeditations in an EmergencybyCameron Awkward-RichThanks for reading spencer's paradoxes!

      <title>first winter chill</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/first-winter-chill</link>
      <description>I feel that you can tell what season it is by the color of the sunset. It feels like it always shines a deeper hue of orange during winter‚Ä¶That first winter chill. A cool breeze from the south penetrates your skin sinking deep into your bones. It makes your skin crawl, a shiver snakes up your arm, around your neck, down your spine. But it doesn't quite feel scary. It's exciting, even as you rub your arms and complain how summer always leaves so fast. It‚Äôs cold, yes. But it‚Äôs also freeing.Winter gives space. It feels like your breaths are naturally deeper, longer. Like time is moving slower. Like every movement you make has to be intentional. Like you're seeing more of life, reallyexperiencingit, rather than watching a blur of frenzied activity happen to you.Thanks for reading spencer's paradoxes! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.SubscribeThere's an air of anticipation. The construction anticipating a building. My breath anticipating being stolen. The hours that linger before the arrival of a party. Warm light beckoning for a movie. A cozy home with two cold bodies standing outside it. The tension of a thousand bodies in the dark the moment the lights shut off before the performance starts. Flying over a quiet world holding its breath before the chaos of an overcrowded airport. The pause between the first kiss and the ‚ÄúI love you.‚ÄùThe chilly air tastes like possibility. Like anything can happen. Like everythingwillhappen. It's the kind of feeling you get every once in a while when you step out of a gathering into a cold winter night, and it's completely quiet. And then you hear your soft breath. And if you stay for a few more moments, you find the sky opening up to a blanket of stars. And you see the soft yellow of the street lights blinking in unison. And you notice amidst the quiet, a steady drumming. A rhythm to the beat of your favorite song. Your heartbeat.One Two.One Two.Your reminder that your blood is flowing. That you‚Äôre breathing. That you're alive. That your life is exactly what you make of it now, in this moment, and in every moment.Every once in a while, a step carries us out of the blitz of everyday life, the work and play and rest and work and work and work and play and play and play and existential crisis and back to work and play and etc., etc. I imagine it‚Äôs similar in intensity to how it feels to emerge from a sensory deprivation chamber into a bright summer day. Except the reaction is the opposite. We emerge from the overwhelming chaos of our lives and find ourselves in an empty space. A place where we don't feel theneedto break out of it, to move onto the next thing, to distract ourselves with our devices and the next dopamine-filled activity and whatever and whoever else is in front of us.At least for a little, we sit with that discomfort. We sit with the emptiness. We sit with the silence. And questions come bubbling up from our hearts that don't usually see the light of day.Who are you?What do you care about? What are you here to do? And would you sit here with me again?I want to take a moment to honor these moments. I want to call your attention to them, to help you see the shape of them, to nudge you to notice them when you feel their familiar texture brush by your hand. I want to tell you to not take them for granted. To be grateful for the respite they offer. To take their shelter even when you feel like you should be going nonstop, that you should be working harder, pushing faster, striving further, loving deeper. I want to tell you this because I know that feeling, the urgency of needing to keep your foot on the gas, to excessively, obsessively accelerate. To fear what happens when you stop. To feel like your whole identity depends on going and going and going. But these moments are worth stopping for. These questions are worth sitting with. The emptiness, the silence, the stillness‚Äîthey give solace when nothing else can.So stop for a bit and sit with me, will you? I‚Äôll get some tea going.it‚Äôs you. / you‚Äôre here.Thanks for reading spencer's paradoxes! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.Subscribe</description>

      <title>recipe for freedom</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/recipe-for-freedom</link>
      <description>some updates on my thinking and work around computing at the bottom. on your way down you can enjoy a reflection on freedom and my relationship to it. thank you for being here and a reminder to please share this with friends you think might enjoy :)Do you feel free?I‚Äôve always felt trapped in a lot of ways. Growing up, I felt like I was moving through quicksand. Ankles trapped in shackles, stomach knotted into a bowtie, a pebble in my throat catching all my words. Looking back I was full of yearning. Iwantedso much but could never bring myself to acquire it. Or maybe I never gave myself permission to get what I wanted.I appeared to have freedom. I could move most of my limbs, wiggle my toes, put up a not-entirely miserable mile time. Given a proper stage and carefully constructed set, I could fabricate the illusion that I could do anything in the world. I was, am, an exceptional actor. I planned out every possible development. I planned out of necessity, frantically drawing out forks and alternative paths as if my life depended on the root system that emerged. But at a certain point my plans ran out. If you peeked behind the scenes, you would find the limits of my range of expression. I could never go beyond a limit I felt was imposed by external forces. There were things I simply did not think were possible for me, where my desires were concerned.I felt beholden to a lot of obligations then. Obligations to how I felt like I needed to be to make friends (the kind of person who uses humor, or more specifically their own laugh, to cope with uncomfortable situations and bullying), the kind of life my parents wanted for me (successful, well-liked, academically high-achieving, well-adapted and polite), the sort of person I thought I had to be to become the ‚Äúsmartest‚Äù kid at school and ‚Äúearn‚Äù a successful future, the type of partner who could solve everything on their own yet still provide all the attention and caring to their partner as needed, the sort of student I thought was prized (obedient: never speaking out of line, questioning the professor, or making excuses about their late homework or their absentee partner), the kind of flawless role model I idolized (a pretentious, self-obsessed dick).Thanks for reading! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.SubscribeOne of my deepest personal projects has been working on becoming free. Possessing inherent freedom to actualize my wants, pursue my interests, love what I love and present myself how I want.I guess I'm in a period where I need to journal. Or maybe I just have a lot of thoughts that want to escape. I find myself thinking more often these days. Thinking about thinking and thinking about doing and thinking about loving. I keep telling people I'm in atransitional period. Basically what I mean is that everything I say about what will happen, about what I will do, about what I'mthinkingabout doing is subject to immense change. That I have intentions. I have hopes and dreams. But they are fluffy, fickle. They don't pin me to the earth like gravity. Like the burdens of reality. One must imagine Sisyphus happy, but I find myself conflicted these days: at once yearning these days for something I can't describe or see and feeling immensely grateful for every beautiful moment in this life that isn't a given. I know treasures abound in the dark, yet I fear what they entail, anticipating a flinch the moment my fingers brush across their outer frame. I feel the need to scramble towards them, to sweep my hands around in the dark frantically, allow my fingers to be pricked, my hands to be sliced. Blood for enlightenment.Lord, I confess I want the clarity of catastrophe but not the catastropheLike everyone else, I want a storm I can dance in.I want an excuse to change my life.‚Äî Franny Choi inCatastrophe is next to GodlinessI think I‚Äôm coming up on another cycle of rebirth. I‚Äôm finding that I reinvent myself every few years now. First when I started college, then when I graduated, and now a few years into my working adult life. As much as I think I dread these moments, I treasure them as unique inflection points to catapult along a carefully aligned path. Existential angst and suspense fuel momentum. And the point of release induces such a cathartic burst of clarity and energy, freedom fireworks exploding all around your soul.I‚Äôm sitting with the building energy now. I can feel the nerves tingling across my body. The excess energy arcing from one hand up through my shoulders to the other every once in a while, forcing my body to twist with the path. I feel nervous but excited. Ready but terrified. I can feel the fog clearing every day. I‚Äôm biding my time, prepping the flares, til the day of celebration.What does it mean to be free? Here‚Äôs my list:you are true to yourself, act according to what feels right in each moment, and feel no inhibition around being that wayyou're willing to fight for your instinct for rightness in the face of external conflictbeing aware of what you're feeling and what your body is calling forI think you want to surround yourself with people who think in different ways from you (notice different things, approach things in different ways), but they should ultimately be headed towards similar directions, drawn to similar sources of resonance (allies rather than just friends)?What do I care about the people around me? How do I picture them being in a way that will empower me to be free?a sense of curiosity for why things work the way they do, why things are the way they arean indomitablejoie de vivrea playfulness and tendency for experimentation for understanding. an openness to being surprised and surprisingan intentionality surrounding their actions and words. A gravity to their lifea pursuit of freedom, a desire for authentic expressiona willingness to be presentin touch with their emotions and what they want and can communicate that effectivelya courage and defiance to their craft that speaks to some deeper comprehension of what they are trying to bring into the world and what they are "fighting" againstA recipe for freedomAnswer the questions above for yourself. What does it mean to be free to you? What kind of people will empower you to be free?Collect a list of all the things (society, friends, parents, your mind, etc.) that make you feel obligated to act some type of way or do anything that feels unnatural in any wayWash them thoroughly to scrub them clean of any lingering bits of self-consciousnessInspect each expectation individually thoroughly before dicing finelyGet a pan oiled and hot and dump all the ingredients insideBurn to a crisp and plate in a nice porcelain bowlWalk over to an airy window and fling the contents outTake a deep breath, taking in the smell of your constraints coming off. Remember the scent of freedom.One of my favorite poems on freedomupdates / extrasI saw this viral tweet about GPT-3 exposed as a formula in Google Sheets GPT-3. Two observations: 1) the demo video matters so much in these crazy magical experiences for showing the extent of the magic (replies show people who had done this before) and 2) this functionality seemed so obvious to me because it took less than an hour to hook this up in Coda using our Packs infrastructure, but I forget how much scaffolding is involved in understanding personal software with tables of data that can talk to arbitrary external services. If you want to try this in Coda with your own OpenAI API token DM me.Shubhro Saha@shubroskiThis weekend I built =GPT3(), a way to run GPT-3 prompts in Google Sheets.

It's incredible how tasks that are hard or impossible to do w/ regular formulas become trivial.

      <title>move towards love</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/move-towards-love</link>
      <description>Chang Dai-chien, Divine Redwood TreesI'm headed to the Haight for an event with Ryan Lee Wong for his debut novel. It's a rainy Monday night, and I ride into the city on the BART, transferring at Montgomery to the MUNI. I find myself surprised at my wonder towards the whole experience: the efficiency, the details of commuting passengers (a man carriesAfterpartiesstuffed into his backpack's bottle pocket, two discuss the recent tech layoffs and their theories of Elon's plans). When I step off by Beit Rima, there's a woman in a full-body bunny suit waving a "No on J" sign who salutes me as I nod back. I walk along the dark, wet streets, eyes drawn to the occasional warm light streaming out of townhouse windows. I take it all in. I breathe in deeply. I find myself looking at every passerby with genuine curiosity, with compassion, with love.Meditation is learning to move towards love when you find itsays Wong. He's a Zen Buddhist, works at the Brooklyn Zen Center, spent two years living at a remote temple in upstate New York as COVID raged the world. He describes how he operated as a different person there. How he interrogated all his motives for writing the book and came up with nothing that felt worthy. How an event began haunting him and anchored him around the community and his story. How from that moment, his very surroundings seemed to conspire to help him finish.Thanks for reading spencer's paradoxes! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.SubscribeI think if you have the courage to move towards what you love, you start to shape your surroundings and the earth itself to help you.It took me at least 23 years (meaning I just started to be aware of this in the past two years) for me to learn and embody this perspective. I learned what I love by learning how to listen (to myself and my inner voice). I learned that I need tobe freein how I pour my all into what I love. The first time I felt this attitude in my body, I felt so much invisible weight lift.For so long I had shouldered extrinsic burdens pushing me to repress what I love. Because it would make some people uncomfortable. Because I would have to make changes to my life. Because it was too much, some might not understand, and was it really that important to me anyways? I pushed it down, buttoned the latches, reinforced the walls with soundproof covers. I covered it with layers and layers and layers of duck tape. Patchwork construction and shodden structures. It's almost as if I was trying to give it a way out, test its metal, forge its strength against increasingly formidable challenges. And then the time came when nothing could keep it down anymore. It would not submit to being caged up again. The weights were off; the old world was dead.Love became accepted. Love became the norm. Love felt limitless, unending, abundant. It was falling from the sky in droves, pouring out of the sidewalks, sprinkled across the grass like those plastic eggs that they put out during Easter, enough for every kid to find several to think they‚Äôre special. Love was a stream in your backyard where you‚Äôd collect water, wash yourself, cut your toe on rocks jumping from side to side. Love was a forever rotating walk with all the people you love. Love was waking up hungover after 3 hours of sleep to hike a mountain at 3AM in the dark for the moment the sun breaks over the horizon and the stones, trees, clouds, tired faces ease into light.My general attitude towards life became one of wearing my heart on my sleeve, seeking to experience and appreciateall of life, even the parts that feel impossible to bear in the moment. I want to move towards what feels right in every moment, to sit with feelings, even when they are sharp or beyond comprehension, to proclaim self-expression from the top of the rooftops. But I find it hard to always embody that. My natural fear takes over sometimes as a self-defense mechanism. Life can help you tear down inner walls, but it can also push you to build even taller ones, with barbed wire lining the tops and sentries patrolling the perimeter. I wondered: how can I gain the strength to say no to walls, to trudge on after each time I fall?Believing in love is like believing in a religion. It requires faith because it avoids understanding.Love is the largest possible word, meaning so much as to mean nothingwrites Helena Fitzgeraldin Griefbacon. Love, despite (or maybe because of) its vacuous nature, asks for your whole self. It demands you to be honest, challenges you to be stubborn, pushes you to the brink. When you find yourself in the depths of doubt, love calls you back. When you‚Äôre expecting least, when you think you‚Äôve escaped beyond walls of reason, you hear sweet in your ear. Then you‚Äôre running. You‚Äôre scaling the walls, leaping over wires. You‚Äôredancing in the minefield.I'd always been scared of "I love you" because it seemed to imply a promise, but these days, I feel and receive love freely. If it can be everything in the world and a bunch of bullshit, I might as well make that jumble of nothing and everything my own.I love the way sunlight lands on my apartment wall during sunset, a little window into a stage for my shadow to dance in. I love the way hands feel, how a finger can share years of history. I love the wind, both when it‚Äôs a gentle breeze caressing my ear and when it‚Äôs a furious gust, vying to blow me away. I love computers and how they can be a medium for creative expression and connection, how they gave me a space to find myself when I felt I couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere else. I love spacious spaces and endearing environments: physical or digital, I love community spaces where I can find peaceful solitude among others. I love parallel play, coexisting, reading side-by-side and clicking away on laptops across from each other at a cafe table. I love the people in my life who make me feel exceptionally safe, who I can tolerate for many hours on end without stop. I love those who inspire me, constantly, intentionally and sometimes not, to be better, to question how I can think clearer, act kinder, love deeper, create freer, laugh harder, dream further. I love those who see and seek out wonder, beauty, dreams, and love, of course, in all of life, in everything they do, in the way they carry themselves. I love people, spaces, objects that carry a loving reverence towards the world and themselves, who seem, with every breath they take, to say to them:thank you. thank you for giving me everything.If you liked this, here‚Äôs a poem from Li-Young Lee you might enjoy:I‚Äôve also been thinking about how software or technology can help us notice, feel, and preserve moments of love. I want to maketools for wonder, those that can help us cultivate a default state of gratitude and generation, that teach us toseek out beauty everywhere. I startedmaintaining a little notewhere I update each time I get the overwhelming sensation of ‚ÄúI love life.‚Äù I find that making lists for these sorts of things is a virtuous cycle because I notice the moments more and grow to appreciate them more. Would love to hear if you have any practices that are similar!the note as of tonightother updatesI released the OpenAI pack for Coda. I‚Äôm excited to see how we can make the power of AI more accessible and put it in the hands of people via their everyday tools and data.

      <title>secret places</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/secret-places</link>
      <description>There‚Äôs a secret I keep about my apartment. Every night around sunset, I put on my shoes, walk up a few flights of stairs, push open the worn door with a threatening ‚Äúalarm will sound‚Äù sign. Emerging from the haze of bright overhead LEDs, my world opens up to blue, growing darker and deeper by the moment, and then a gradient of orange, stretching down to meet the skyline of San Francisco on the horizon. There‚Äôs a concrete walkway lining the edges of the roof and a large bed of rocks filling in the middle. I peer over the left edge and see a line of cars, flashing their hazards, waiting by the local elementary school, a chaotic choir of lights. I see the horde of traffic streaming over the Bay Bridge‚Äîpeople returning home or going into the city for a night on the town, or merely passing through this enclave on the bay. I look towards the dark hills in the distance: Bernal Heights, Treasure Island, Marin Headlands; past moments in those spots drift by, and I picture a speck of my old self staring back at myself.I love being up here: pacing, sitting, hanging with the gulls. It feels like my own secret hideaway despite how many live in this building of 16 floors. I‚Äôll bring a mug of tea, a puffer jacket, sometimes headphones to dance with the wind, among the clouds and birds.Thanks for reading spencer's paradoxes! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.SubscribeI make homes by sprinkling meaning throughout, until there‚Äôs a sufficient density of personal affect that makes a place feel like mine. I love being intimate with little slices of a city off the beaten path. They don‚Äôt all have to be hidden away on a roof (although rooftops are certainly a favorite). Often, they are secrets in plain sight. Like the intersection near my first house in SF, where the 14 took me to work, that I used to run to in the mornings in various states of readiness, hair in a jumble, shoelaces haphazardly tied, backpack clacking along to my steps. Or the little outlet by the water where the sight of the bridge would catch my breath every time I passed, where I wrote a poem about the dancing waters, where I wondered if everything was really going to be ok. The one intersection on the border of Potrero and Mission where the hill peaks and you can see Sutro Tower on one side and the skyline on the other, where you feel like a peer with the birds for a fleeting moment.The part I love most about this practice is that it gives endlessly. Reality has so much detail that there are limitless spots open to being impressed with meaning. And there‚Äôs no limit to the number of places you choose to make meaning with. There‚Äôs no pressure on the relationship, no expectation around what needs to constitute meaning. It‚Äôs a deeply personal, spiritual practice of conversing and playing with the world. An act of resistance in the attention arena of the modern world. It‚Äôs a practice that reminds us: we canchooseto focus on the things that matter to us,no matter how ‚Äúlittle‚Äù they are. We canstop. Temper the tempest for a moment. We decide what deserves our witness.We have the power to consecrate our surroundings and relationships. To approach everything with both the sanctity and playfulness that life deserves.There‚Äôs a paradox here. By imbuing things with meaning, we are committing a sacred, prayer-like act. We are sayingthis, here, mattersat some deep, planetary level. However, because this act is infinitely abundant, it inherently feels light and playful rather than somber and reserved. We have not only the agency but the responsibility to decide what matters. We can wield meaning with ease, swing sanctity with deft, spin reverence with play.What we pay attention to matters.This sounds pretty obvious, but it‚Äôs hard to embody and live out. When you think about what you love, what other voices speak up? I have a tendency to wait and see, to reserve my judgement until I‚Äôm more sure, butthe urge to save is the signal to spend it now.Life is too short and detailed to wait for the best time to listen to yourself.What we pay attention to dictates our life, its trajectory and its outcomes. It determines who we spend our time with, what we spend our time on, where and how we live our lives. Our attention is the essence of our will and spirit. Attention is the stuff of manifestation. In the same way that looking at something while you‚Äôre driving takes you there, paying attention to anything (a field, an attitude, a person), will drive you uncontrollably toward it.‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve always been drawn to dreamers, particularly people who action on their dreams. Because they reallylookfor ways to turn it into a reality.‚Äù ‚ÄîNicoleRobert Irwin dedicated his life to attuning people to their sense of perception because of his belief in its ability to change everything: ‚ÄúThe ordinary, could we but see it is just as extraordinary as the highest consciousness imaginable.‚Äù Rather than staying in the realm of ideas and thought, speaking of the theoretical and the metaphorical. Irwin urged us to pay attention to what we experientially felt, to embrace our instinct for meaning and resonance.My secret places are small, but essential, acts of meaning-making in a world that demands every moment of my attention and more. I‚Äôm practicing the art of attention, tuning my sense of what I value, becoming intimate with the world through mutual resonance.What do you pay attention to? What do youwantto pay attention to? What do you want to see more of? What kind of world do you want to imagine? Give yourself permission todream big, to want what you want, to search for what you‚Äôre compelled by. You have the power to find what you seek if you just let yourself look for it.hoping everyone has a cozy thanksgiving week ‚ù§Ô∏è-spencerupdatesI have been feeling some amount ofgrieftowards what is happening with Twitter. It changed my life (dramatic but true) by giving me space to express myself, share my creations, and bring me into community with so many friends, co-schemers, and inspirations.

      <title>the faces of objects</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/the-faces-of-objects</link>
      <description>this was mostly written in August when I moved out of my old place in San Francisco. I hope everyone has a restful Thanksgiving weekend!Geo Eye (Victoria Peak) by Takahiro IWASAKII‚Äôm sitting on a couch in the shell of a home. We‚Äôre moving. Or rather, we havebeen moving. At some point in the past month we stopped living here and beganmoving. It didn‚Äôt happen all at once in some grand climax where the house is emptied in a chaotic afternoon, belongings ejected onto the street like overflowing garbage. Nor did it happen seamlessly, where everything teleports into a picture-perfect apartment by an army of movers, as if by magic. It happened as most things do now, in a slow, messy shift. These transitionary moments linger like punctuation marks, little commas where time drags and the awkward assemblage of your past, present, and future are all in the same room, forcing themselves to make small talk with each other.One roommate moved most of their stuff out a couple weeks ago, leaving gaps in the common spaces where communal art and furniture used to live. I‚Äôve been selling my stuff on Facebook Marketplace, coming up with listing descriptions that strike the balance between sensational and search-legible for things I had forgotten existed. Every time a new item is taken, I take another picture of the newly emptying state of the home, tracing a slow but steady pilfering of a home. My body is forced to acclimate, almost daily, to a new home, one rapidly emptying of things, which, even if not sentimentally meaningful, are significant simply because of their constant, now assumed but absent, presence. Meaning and value emerged in the seams of our home through moments of sharing space accumulating, little emotional bits of lint clinging to our bodies that we can‚Äôt seem to get off no matter how hard we swipe.I don‚Äôt feel the need to sell these objects for the money (although I‚Äôm not complaining about the new reserve for serving our capitalist overlords furnishing my next place). I feel bad seeing perfectly good things go to the garbage. I relish finding gems in other people‚Äôs trash, so it‚Äôs excruciating when I‚Äôm on the other end, forced to make a final, fatal judgment on the ultimate value of the seemingly infinite pile of goods spilling out of the closets.Despite so much more to move, it feels like the place has already started to move on. Like a ghost swept through and kidnapped random swaths of my home. Large art pieces disappeared from the wall. The lemon-shaped lemon squeezer is gone too. I looked for it for a couple minutes before resigning myself to manual labor. The foam roller that I used to unknot my legs has found a new pair to call its companion. Each electronic component of a mini home theater has been slowly packed up and set on display like statues. Taunting me with their promise of a second, perhaps better, life.Thanks for reading spencer's paradoxes!

Even after all the use, it‚Äôs pristine, not a spot to be seen. It‚Äôs as if we‚Äôve never been intimate together. Isn‚Äôt that a bit sad? Despite 1000 nights conforming our bodies to each other‚Äîmattress and I shaping each other through the arc of my back, the crane of my head, the curl of my toes‚Äîthere‚Äôs no trace of me to be found. My tossing and turning, alterations between my back and my sides, the times I‚Äôve slept sideways and backwards, when I attempted (and failed) to substitute it for an exercise mat to do leg lifts. None of it made a mark. ¬†Not even my shadow can be found on its pristine foam surface. Did none of it matter after all?I sold my very first camera, too, to J, who I hope will have as intimate of a journey with her as I did. It‚Äôs a Nikon D3300. I got it from Amazon through one of those over-packed bundles, full of everything you might think of needing and more, during one of those flash Cyber Monday deals. It was one of the few moments in college when I decided to carve out space for myself, buying something that would actualize my burning desire to be a photographer. No longer leaving the desire to fate and chance, I shook the world and started carving my own path. It traveled with me across the world. It still has the scar on its forehead from when it scraped by a rock while scaling a mountain in Thailand, the black paint exposing a silvery undercoat. I think it looks more badass this way, markings of battle and adventure. My hands were shaped by her‚ÄîI learned how to cradle a camera through our time together, how to dance together to find the right framing, how to listen to the light through our shared eyes and turn my gaze on the unnoticed, mundane spots moments of beauty. Just as I‚Äôll never forget the memories we forged together, she‚Äôll bear the signs of our adventures together forever.Happy Old Year is a Thai film that depicts a woman who is trying to clear out her home of all the old stuff in it to embrace a modern minimalist design.Objects come and go like friends. Some from everyday buddies to complete strangers, traveled to some bygone world, hail-Maryed to a corner of the world you‚Äôll never visit. Some forget you in an instant, pretend they never knew you, set history on fire and charge into a new future without you. Others linger, like orphaned shadows. They squirm to find a new way of living divorced from you, burning at the knowledge that a piece of them will always belong to you.It‚Äôs easy to set a blanket intention from the start.I‚Äôm going to have a fresh start.Choosing a blank canvas is the easiest, if you can avoid attachment.Throw it all away and we‚Äôll buy it all again.There is nothing more satisfying (as long as you practice burying the hint of awareness around how unsettling itshouldfeel) than unfettered, indiscriminate erasure. Packing up large black trash bags with your entire life. That photo album from 5 years ago, the postcards from across the world, and the still-wrapped birthday presents tossed as quickly and efficiently as the now-discolored nails spent shouldering decorations.I‚Äôve recently taken a special interest in items from my parents‚Äô youth. I‚Äôve been collecting little wearable mementos of my family history: a chain of gold flowers from my mom, a traditional silk jacket from my dad, a double-collared sweater my brother wore in middle-school. The tradition of passing down family heirlooms is going out of fashion, but even when it was common, it was mostly used as a way of passing down a stable store of money for emergencies. My mom said Nai Nai used to keep some gold jewelry for this purpose, but it‚Äôs all gone now. They had no meaning because they were never used. Their purpose was practical. A personal bank. One that wouldn‚Äôt disappear when our institutions failed us again. I‚Äôm more interested in everyday family heirlooms. Mementos that have passed from ancestral hand to ancestral hand. The loyal companions that have become recorders of history, collecting stories through the bodies that carried them.We use a small number of objects disproportionately more compared to the vast set of objects we encounter every day. And often the ones we use the most are most unremarkable, at least they seem to be on first glance. But even the most unremarkable pen or shoe becomes suffused with meaning over time. I remember there was a fraying, impractically small orange-and-yellow blanket that I slept with for over 8 years of my life. It was my most prized possession for a long time. It‚Äôs hard to recall it now, but I have no doubt it would obviously look like trash on immediate impression. It is sure to be one of the first casualties were the judgment of value delegated to movers who don‚Äôt know me. Every time my parents offered or even tried to buy a new one, I would revolt as if my life depended on it.If you take some time to look closer, there are tells for when an object has become imbued with meaning. You can tell when wear has accrued from natural use. The pattern of wear is a complete timeline of its relationship with people. Certain patches of the blanket were softer and thinner, my favorite places to rub for comfort. I was creating my own fabric pattern through my use of the blanket, art crafted over a childhood with my everyday instincts.We don‚Äôt pay much attention to objects in our lives. If you look closely enough, you‚Äôll see faces emerge. You‚Äôll find contours that form mouths, creases that form wrinkles, uneven ovals for eyes. Sometimes they‚Äôll touch you. Mostly they watch. Carried from one event to another, or dropped into a cardboard box, locked away from light.Fromcouchesto blankets to water bottles, anything can become treasure. We‚Äôre all alchemists if we let ourselves. Our hands are blessed by Midas; we have the power to create emotional gold. Coming into communion with an object means forming a relationship together. It means cultivating a living attachment with something not quite living. We learn to recognize and give gratitude to the faces of our nonhuman brethren, and in return, they tell us the stories of our lives.We are magicians. We can bring things to life with our very presence. Create golems with our attention. They often don‚Äôt walk or talk or spin around for circus shows. But they receive us. Fully and willingly. They mold themselves to our behavior, our wants and needs. Theybear witnessand accompany us, unfailingly.They give us the spaceto be free. The permission tosimply exist. Theagency to make disturbancesthat last.Thanks for reading spencer's paradoxes! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.Subscribe</description>

      <title>surrendering</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/surrendering</link>
      <description>Lotus Circle/Lotus Goddess, 1986-88, by Bernice BingGrowing up I was terrified of surprise. I sought to extinguish them from my life. I never wanted to be out of control again, lest I embarrass myself or look stupid in front of my class or all the other worst-case scenarios that played on loop in my head. I liked to play it safe, needed to know exactly what was going to happen and how to respond in the perfect way. Over time, I distilled the art of being in control at all times down to a science.Of course, like any effective theory, it only worked in very controlled environments, under very specific assumptions. So I chose to give up a lot ofnormallife in exchange for this power. New social situations were too chaotic for me, so I avoided them with a fervor that most would associate with a deep resentment of or indifference towards others. The ‚Äúarts‚Äù was a field I had never tried much and had failed at every time I had, so I rejected my internal protests whenever remotely close to that ideological area piqued my interest. Being someone disagreeable was out of the question because it meant I would have to respond to people‚Äôs arguments, so I doused myself in water until all my spice drained down the sink.Thanks for reading spencer's paradoxes! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.SubscribeThe issue, as I discovered later, was I had cut life down to such an excruciatingly narrow slice that it was rarely interesting to me. I was confronted with a persistent boredom. Every day felt the same. Problems were slight annoyances but easily solvable (of course, any option too difficult was eliminated under my conditions for a controllable environment). It‚Äôs as if I had eliminated surprise from life, intentionally wilted the flowers, forced my head back into the cave. For power, I gave upwonder. For control, I gave up love.As life went on, Irediscovered love. I learned you have to look stupid to do anything meaningful in life. You have to embrace chaos to find resonance. You have to become intimate with awkwardness to be fully at peace. You have to know pain to recognize love.Now, I love surprises andnot knowing. Where before just the thought of that would fill me with anxiety, I feel a budding excitement. After acataclysm, life came rushing back, like lush forests sprung from volcanic soil.I love when the world surprises me. Plants that smell different than they look. Food that looks different from how it tastes. Colors that make an unexpected pairing or how long a plant can survive despite the negligence of its owner. Spotting the moon peeking out during the day, watching its steady growth cycle over the month and then getting to see it do it all over again in a new part of the sky. Surprising combinations of reflecting light against the side of a building, spotlighting a beautiful multi-colored autumn tree, highlighting the imprint of my shadow, my bike and I forming a centaur-like figure, against the pavement.I love when people around me surprise me. Unexpected feats of strength from small bodies. Delicate movements from bodies that tower over the world. Outfits that make me stop and think to myself,I want to have that amount of personality. When a laugh will slice straight though a chaotic day. The way pure enthusiasm bubbles and spreads like a virus from someone gushing passionately about something or someone they love. How warm a hand can feel even when it‚Äôs clearly frozen solid and the air has sucked feeling out of your extremities.I especially love when I surprise myself. This feeling is usually directly triggered from the above two, so they all play together in a nice virtuous loop. When I notice how what I notice in the world has changed, paying attention to the beauty in the mundane. The times I see how my ability to bear witness has evolved, sitting comfortably giving my full attention to the people around me. How being by myself in public no longer terrifies me or makes me self-conscious. When I find myself confidently taking in my stride down a city block.Even though I don‚Äôt easily getoverwhelmedby emotiondespitefeelingdeeply and I find being overwhelmed uncomfortable, I love the sense of abandon I get in these rare moments. They feel like glimpses at something approaching emotional truth, the commandments of my personal canon. Each of these surprises is a little progress marker, showing me how I‚Äôm growing and changing, moving in some direction that I‚Äôm gazing towards. These moments are clues at a deeper personal resonance that I didn‚Äôt even know existed.So take this as a sign to look for surprise. Submit to surrender. Instead of running away, let it wash over you. Relinquish control to the world. Treat it as your greatest responsibility. Surrendering is an act of courage. It saysI trust myself to let go.On Earth We‚Äôre Briefly Gorgeousby Ocean VuongThanks for reading spencer's paradoxes!

      <title>alternate lives</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/alternate-lives</link>
      <description>Above the Clouds by Hung LiuI frequently get pulled into trains of thought about my alternate lives. In multiverse movies, this would be my differenttimelines, ones where I became a movie star or a kung fu fighter (alaEverything Everywhere All At Once) or, for me, ones where my creative yearning manifested in different fields (visual art, dance, acting) or didn‚Äôt manifest at all. I imagine a world where I moved to a different city straight out of college, one where I didn‚Äôt get that tech startup internship my sophomore year and struggled to ‚Äúget in‚Äù the tech bubble without that golden ticket of a name, the one where COVID didn‚Äôt strike so soon and I actually I went on that planned trip to Iceland for the drive around Ring Road, the more drastic ones where I wasn‚Äôt born with social anxiety and loved talking to people.With the craze around ChatGPT lately,Carolyn came up with an ingenious wayto use it to imagine and explore these alternate timelines. They created a multiverse mapper prompt template where you can add your personal details to get tailored responses of alternate timelines. I tried it out and although they were mostly pretty out there and humorous, it still feels like a very powerful way to remind you about the possibilities your life contains. It‚Äôs a nice reminder for breaking free of the illusion of the local maxima or that you‚Äôre stuck on your current path for the rest of your life.I like that it is based on cheese-toasted sandwiches rather than grilled cheeses.. [FAST FOOD CHEESE TOASTER] Spencer might be onto something...This power doesn‚Äôt come without risk. I was talking to S about this recently, and she mentioned the danger of idolizing alternate lives as a form of self-pitying. And the Multiverse Mapper can make it all too easy tointellectualizealternative paths and never attempt to live them. You get the reward of knowing whatmight bewithout having to do the work to see what life will actually turn out like.I know these dangers all too well. Growing up, I resented my anxiety. It felt like playing with a handicap. I clawed at my stomach as if that would shut my insatiable pits. I yanked at my legs as a form of aggressive prayer to stop the shaking. I closed my eyes and imagined happy places‚Äîtrite images of idyllic dreams: floating in the middle of a pristine alpine lake or wandering a misty forest trail‚Äîhoping they would fool me into pacification.I never managed to trick myself. And because of that, I found myself imagining a world where the problem had never existed. I wondered about an alternate timeline where I was effortlessly charismatic. The kind of guy who could walk into a crowded room without a soul they knew, insert themselves into groups of lifelong friends, and become a natural part of their timelines, the same as if they‚Äôd been with them all along.When I was solo traveling for the first time in Budapest during a dark winter, I stayed at a hostel, the kind for young people where the bar would be bumping all night long. After a day of exploring, I lingered outside the double doors to the bar, attempting to casually peer my head in to survey the scene. I longed for company but was too scared to go in. Instead, I rationalized going to bed early:I have an early day packed with plans tomorrow, and only have a few days to see it all. I don‚Äôt really need to socialize with them, what does it matter anyways? I won‚Äôt see any of them again.When I talk to other people about my current state of being intimate with so many different paths in front of me, wanting to have all of them, several have brought up Sylvia Plath‚Äôs fig tree anecdote:‚ÄúI saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.‚Äù‚ÄîSylvia Plath in The Bell JarIt‚Äôs often referenced as a warning, to admonish sitting around thinking about alternate paths for your life rather than living them. It‚Äôs used in the way a well-meaning, slightly overbearing parent chides their child when they‚Äôre daydreaming all the time, tells them to go do their homework or practice the piano. It‚Äôs a push to do somethingnow,to make something of your life rather than dreaming of different ones.But I‚Äôve found that single-minded pushing only makes me dread jumping into an alternate path more. I push, and Existential Angst pushes back with twice the force.Forcing makes things worse, so where do we go from here? It‚Äôs okay to be unproductive, to sit with your loss and wanderings. I need to grieve past lives, properly mourn them, before I can move on; otherwise, they haunt me like ghosts with unsettled grievances, questioning whether I made the right choice after all. Maybe we don‚Äôt need to pressure ourselves to always pick something with the weight of finality. Maybe we can meander along our paths, consider the figs that grow among us, and sample little nibbles at will. Some will die, we think too early. Others will pass on having finished their business. The dark wrinkled bodies at our feet aren‚Äôt to be lamented‚Äîthey will come back as fresh seedlings. Fresh, plump life dreams in the spring.Rather than limitingwhat-ifs, alternate lives feel like possibilities. Imaginations. Alternate dreams for inspiration. What if? As in, what if a piece of that different life could be seeded for my future? As in, what if I could take a piece of that attitude and form a practice around cultivating it? As in, what if I could direct my future to incorporate all these possibilities that inspire me, bit by bit? So the figs sprout, bloom, and ripen: a limitless bushel of dreams for me to sample from in my single life.</description>

      <title>boring lives</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/boring-lives</link>
      <description>lanterns for Lunar New Year in Pacific Renaissance Plaza downstairsI'm sitting in Flywheel watching the rain go by and thinking about boring lives. I just finishedTomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow, and there's a scene that keeps playing in my head. One of the main characters is lamenting how boring their life is recently. Their friend chides them that others would call ithappiness. In the world of making games (the main characters are video game designers), you're expected to pour your whole life and more into your work. You are a worldmaker, "a seer of unseen worlds." When you‚Äôre used to creating entirely new worlds and life slows to a crawl, you‚Äôre left thinking, what does it all mean?Especially in the always-on of today‚Äôs young professional world, we take it to mean the death of life. We thrash against the loss of youth, the purging of our energy. As a preventative mechanism, we decide to uproot our lives, cut off our ties, remake our lives in search of that dynamism, the spice of life. We‚Äôre addicted to novelty, captured by transformation. We love ourfreedomand our agency and we love being able to do whatever we want and feel like doing, even if it means destroying sources of grounding, just to prove a point. A demonstration that yes, in fact,we still got it.Lives are mass-produced now. We‚Äôve cracked the Industrial Revolution for ways of being. If we don‚Äôt like the live we have, we can throw it out, swap it out piecemeal for a new one, fresh from the latest machinations of social media. Our freedom makes us reckless. We aren‚Äôt afraid of losing anything when we can trade it in for everything else in the blink of an eye. We have too much money and time on our hands. We crave meaning but settle for excessively expensive lamps, edgy outfits from the SSENSE sale, and back-to-back nomadic travels. We are afforded an easy life. We fuel the economy and see the world. We enjoy the luxuries of life. We‚Äôre living theAmerican Dream, yet we feel deeply unsettled. We don‚Äôt have what we want, not really. Probably because we don‚Äôt know what we want. The effects of our go-to therapies, retail, wanderlust, among the traditional practices, only last so long and go so far. We feel tired. Our arms are drooping with our eyes, and in those blinks of lucid dreaming we catch a glimpse of the pit of meaning staring back at us from the bottom of our soul.We‚Äôre scared of repetition in our world of limitless novelty. We‚Äôre afraid of being boring, of being seen as someone who leads a boring life, of losing our edge for keeping up with the times. A new restaurant, a new shoe, a new life. It‚Äôs always fun and exciting. Never boring. Never still. Never steady. And why not embrace novelty when we have the abundance to afford it? Why not sample the world for all it has to offer?When we‚Äôre used to novelty, it becomes the main thing we see when we encounter new things. When something is exciting, that value judgment is coming from its novelty more so than an aspect of its identity. We lose the ability to see things for what they are, to bear witness to pieces of life authentically.Newness is fun and novelty can spark inspiration, but only when these things are grounded in something constant, when there‚Äôs a foundation to evolve from. When everything is constantly shifting, where can you find a home? What is real when nothing stays?We‚Äôre scared of repetition because we think it‚Äôs boring, plain, absolutely dreadful. But repetition doesn‚Äôt have to be doing the same thing over and over. It can mean consistency. Building a practice, cultivating a ritual, repeating your dedication to someone and something every dayagain, again, again.Committing doesn't mean rejecting dynamism. We often confuse choosing to stay with giving up the freedom to explore. It's popular to pit these two principles against each other as opposites: do you live free with no ties at all, or do you chain yourself to a single way of living? Do you choose freedom or comfort? You can choose both. You can find novelty in the boring. You can commit todynamism in the rituals that ground you: vary the paths towards knowing, discover unmapped territory, name undiscovered species.Consistency is a commitment to honoring the things you know you love and a promise to reach for the things you want. It‚Äôs a devotion to savoring every ounce of the goodness that you've found. It‚Äôs repeating an exercise, feeling your muscles develop, and finding a new challenge in the repetition. It‚Äôs finding novelty in noticing more detail of the same reality. It‚Äôs an exercise inlearning to see.Our belongingsand our surroundings are brimming with stories to tell us if we spend enough time with them.Although there‚Äôs benefit to complete rebirth, I think it‚Äôs easy to rely on as a crutch for change. I realized that doing something new, actively inventing it piece by piece, doesn't mean upturning your life every day. In fact, it‚Äôs often about choosing a ‚Äúboring life.‚Äù Committing to chipping away at a raw stone, piece by piece, until you sculpt the shape of the life you realize you‚Äôve been looking for. It means staying with the things that bring you joy and meaning while still looking forsurprisein the everyday.</description>

      <title>creative seeing</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/creative-seeing</link>
      <description>making jamAt a dinner party the other week, I was telling someone the story of how I made jam for S. The mere fact that I made jam was incomprehensible to this person, and I was explaining how it really wasn‚Äôt such a big deal.See, there‚Äôs this open-air terrace on the 3rd floor of my Oakland spot. I often go down there to walk a few cycles for some fresh air. Last fall, I noticed some tantalizing yellow and red berries growing on the trees by the entrance.tree just starting to bloom in late September.I have a bad habit of sampling things in nature that look edible out of curiosity, but I resisted this time out of abundant caution and instead, admired how beautiful the trees stood against the blue sky, with their red and yellow children swinging in wind. Every time I went down for my walk, I continued to notice them and greet them.A month later, I looked them up usingNatureID, an app to help you identify plants (thank you K), and I found out that they werestrawberry trees! A quick Google search assured me that they were edible, so I took a few ripe ones back, rinsed them, and took a timid bite. Yum! It had a mild sweetness and a satisfying crunch with the prickly skin.The next day I tried them on toast with almond butter after enjoying them as an accompaniment for the half-crescent moon during the day.After a few more weeks, I noticed that most of the berries were starting to fall and rot. I wondered what I could do with all these berries to make use of them before they all went to waste. I had already used them effectively as a crude sort of jam on the toast before, so I thoughtwhat if I just collect a bunch and make jam?A few Google searches and a slow-burning pot later, and I had some nicely mashed berries in jam form (I did have to do some creative climbing to retrieve berries from the taller branches in order to have enough for jam).tada! the finished productlook at trees the way you would look at a face, approach the world the way you came into itBack at the party the reaction waswow, you actually look at trees - I just see a tree. You look at it and think about it creatively.And he was right in perceiving how I looked at the tree, but I didn‚Äôt do anything particularly special to make the jam. The idea and corresponding action emerged naturally from my way of looking at my surroundings. I didn‚Äôt do anything special; it was a natural consequence of my way of existing in relation with the world. In fact, it would‚Äôve felt incongruous with my worldview if I did not make jam, so you could even say that I did it out of a selfish reason.Try as I might, I couldn‚Äôt pinpoint a specific trigger moment that lead to this change in perspective. I wonder about how to cultivate this sort of mindset because it‚Äôs the kind of thing I really wished for when I was just yearning tobe creative. And it‚Äôs the same sort of question I find myself without a satisfying answer to when friends who are refocusing energies on starting a creative practice ask mehow are you creative?The only answer that sits with me is that being creative stems from training acreative way of seeing.So how do you train or experience this kind of seeing?I have a suspicion that this sort of seeing emerges from approaching the world with a natural curiosity and gratitude for the resonance of each moment. If look for beauty in what is given, rather than wishing for something else, then it‚Äôs natural for ideas of new forms (creation) to spring forth from everyday encounters with the world.You also have to develop a taste. Creation is the act of bringing something nonexistent into reality. You have to have strong opinions about how the world should work. You have to think that things should be a certain way, that you prefer this color over that, this form of walking over another, this sense of beauty over theirs, this way of approaching the world over some other. Taste gives you the capability and the urgency to imagine.So in short,approach the world with a natural curiositybe grateful for found resonances in each momentknow what you prefer, have strong emotional reactions and opinionslisten to your instinctBy being curious and grateful, you can be present for the world. Some of the infinite detail and beauty of reality reveals itself to you, and you‚Äôre able to distinguish the ones that differ moment to moment. These details serve as constant opportunities to test your taste. These emotional reactions lead to a place of generation, where you mold the current state of world into one that is according to your taste, and if not exactly your taste, at least more palatable than the status quo.sourceof highlighted excerpt from George Saunders on his writing processFollow your curiosity about the world. Apply your preference. Listen to how your body reacts. And repeat it again and again. Creation is an act of thinking that something newdeservesto be in the world. It‚Äôs a radical act of feeling that something nonexistent needs to be manifested into reality, so what will you bring into existence?</description>

      <description>TLDR; I‚Äôve moved on from Coda and pursuing independent research and art. Broadly, I‚Äôm focusing on imagining futures of computing rooted in communal agency, the kind with new ways formaking spaceand relating to each other on the internet and community-owned,small-scaleinfrastructure.Follow my journey onmy research log, message me if you‚Äôd like to collaborate, andsponsor meif you‚Äôre able to support my work.SubscribeAfter 3.5 years of building, learning, prototyping, designing, proposingwhat if..., pitching streetwear merch, and advocating for stocking Ito En Green Tea in the fridges, I‚Äôve moved on from Coda.I joined a small team of ~50 out of college and have had the opportunity to help build out and imagine everything across monetization infrastructure, sign up methods, information organization and customization capabilities, creating aplatform for reusable snippets, and lately simplifying and exploring the frontier of extending Coda‚Äôs functionality through thePacks Platform.celebrating our ad campaign in SF and a 1:1 with Alicia in our magical sprout.I still can‚Äôt believe how much has changed since I considered the offer over 4 years ago. After signing, I remember forcing the product upon my school club, even with all the pain points that would be considered ridiculous in the product today. More than ever, it‚Äôs a tool for easily making personal and collaborative software tools and enables anyone to use their data for what matters. And I‚Äôm inspired by the amazing things people are doing withPacksand the budding community of daring makers exploring that frontier. I can‚Äôt wait to see how it continues to grow as a maker. Although words are insufficient, I‚Äôm so grateful to all the people who‚Äôve walked with me on this journey1.what now?More than ever, I‚Äôm facing life with a light heart and free mind.

I‚Äôm embracing my wide-ranging, often seeminglyunrelated creativeexplorations. Each day presents another opportunity (and responsibility) for me to follow what my heart sayswithout reservation. Despite an undercurrent of doubt (what am I even doing? will I really figure it out?), I feel mywings tensing, flexing, leaning towards flight.howJackydescribed my situation poeticallyI feel called to rest, recenter, and spend dedicated time away from a computer to get to know the land and ecosystems I inhabit. Yet, I‚Äôm also filled with an urgent energy that warms my body and reminds me why I‚Äôm alive in moments of stillness. I feel compelled to explore, learn, and create in service of the internet and thekind of technologythat I believe in.I‚Äôm intimate with the pain I feel when my mom blames herself when her devices and websites fail her. I‚Äôm intimate with the disquiet I feel when encountering the beauty of humanity in the comments section and think about how much of the internet has been taken over by emotionless content and faceless storefronts. I‚Äôm intimate with the frustration I feel using technology at all the ways that software feels so much harder to make than it should be, that the internet feels so far out of our control, that so much of the fundamental digital infrastructure we depend upon can bedismantledinaninstant, no matter how much we demonstrate love or offer ourselves and our valuable data chests.In service of this energy, I‚Äôm undertaking an indefinite ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù sabbatical to follow all the gathered questions, resonances, and dreams that are overflowing from mycarrier bag.becoming a [computing-internet-creative] [researcher-artist-technologist-???](clearlystill searching for a term that feels right, or maybe I don‚Äôt need just one term and should embrace these multiplicities?)That means I‚Äôm focusing on everything I‚Äôve written about exploring as a full-time practice.

      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/ti-02-first-independent-note</link>
      <description>This is my first lab update after going full-time researcher! There are so many things that call my attention in this space that I want to give dedicated time to, and I‚Äôm excited to follow my nose to explore this ever-expanding tunnel. I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôll find or how much ‚Äúuse‚Äù it will be, but I know that it‚Äôll be fun and interesting. So thank you for sitting with me in my searching, questioning, and wandering.I would like to explicitly extend an invite for you to make yourself at home in this space of writing and prototyping. I envision my lab notes as an open workshop, one where you can feel free to redline and tinker and give open feedback. I writeto riffand to seed open questions, and the cycle is only completed through your generous attention and response.As I‚Äôve been talking to many people about my explorations, this rough diagram of overlapping interests has formed:This week, I‚Äôve been exploring some prototypes and experiences around...atten:embedded sites for reorienting attention:demo videoI‚Äôve been framing this exploration as the opposite of a todo-list, something that rejects optimization and getting things done and rather an instrument for sitting with things that you want to linger and become intimate with, as well as cultivate grounding rituals. There are two aspects:Prompting: You supply a list of prompts, and every so often, it will confront you while you are browsing the web and ask you to answer (answers are saved to a destination of your choice).Remembering: You supply a data source of things that you want to remember or sit with. These are embedded in the sites you already go to every day to reorient your attention when you are overwhelmed by the flood. (currently I‚Äôm supplying anare.nachannel)Let me know if you‚Äôd like to use this and where you‚Äôd like to source the list of information from!

      <title>believing in believing in people</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/believing-in-believing-in-people</link>
      <description>Oakland Museum of California: one of my favorite places to encounter people, and one of my favorite pieces there, Untitled S.365 by Ruth AsawaToday, I had two encounters with people that reminded me how beautiful, loving, and gracious people are. They didn‚Äôt happen in a glittering room or a grungy exhibit; they happened in unexpected, everyday places. I have often felt the need to seek out oases of the right people, some cozy spot shielded away from the public, but these reminded me how much life spirit is everywhere.Earlier, I rode the bus home and sat near the back where a couple of guys had a few cases of Modelo and were chatting in Spanish, handing out free beers to anyone who talked with them. My Spanish is fairly rusty, but of what I could make out, they were gushing to each other about how good life was because they get to eat meat and drink beer.Aqui, trabaje y tiene comida, tiene cerveza, tiene familia, que alegre.With every mention ofalegre, a big smile struck across their faces. The sun was shining, the skies were blue, and they were enjoying a few cold ones on a Thursday at 2pm. I loved it. I couldn‚Äôt help cracking a smile and studying their faces, noting the joyful wrinkles around the eyes.a photo I took on the bus of the sky showing through the emergency exit on the ceilingLater, I called a bank customer service line and kept getting transferred between several agents, all of which asked me for my card number and went through the same long list of steps to verify that I was who I said I was. There was no waiting music or other indication for when the transfer went through, so I had to keep robotically chiming in ‚Äúhello?‚Äù every minute or so to check in. In the course of this comical, annoying, and tiresome experience, a portal to connection was opened just a crack, which soon burst open. Here‚Äôs how it started:The woman on the other end apologizes for keeping me waiting:‚ÄúI‚Äôm still relatively new at this, just started here 2 weeks ago.‚Äù‚Äúmmm‚Äù*pause as I debate probing further*‚Äúis it fun so far?‚Äù‚Äúwell‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs actually quite stressful for me since i don‚Äôt want to mess things up ¬†for anyone.‚Äù‚Äúah, well you‚Äôve been really diligent for me so i appreciate that and i‚Äôm sure you were with others as well.‚Äù‚ÄúI appreciate you saying that‚Ä¶I just want to do the best I can at whatever I do.‚ÄùI felt a pang in my navel then. The last line reads so clich√©, but there was something about the way she said it, an indication of her conviction in the statement, that made it feel so powerful. In the context of a customer service call about something incredibly boring as banking transfers, we had formed a bond. I didn‚Äôt even know her name, yet in that moment, I knew exactly how she felt. I felt a deep intimacy, similar to the kind I feel when exchanging dreams and honest feelings with close friends. In that small exchange, she had entrusted a piece of her heart to me.I don‚Äôt know why these events struck me so much. For the bus, perhaps it‚Äôs because of all the discourse around public transportation in SF being terrible and dangerous and unusable. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve always been the person that will take public transit everywhere (partly from an illogical aversion to paying for a rideshare and partly because it‚Äôs an opportunity for surprise and for movingwith and inthe place you live in).Perhaps it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve been pushing myself to actually express my curiosity about people to them, to crack open the door to intimacy with the people I encounter everyday.They don‚Äôt sound significant; they‚Äôre not the stuff of movie epics. But they were laden with meaning to me. They justified my philosophy of believing in people.I can‚Äôt help but think people are so amazing. And I also can‚Äôt help but think about all thesenseless violencecommitted by people, too. Along with all the hope and joy and warm fuzzy feelings I feel from these two encounters, I feel an underlying current of unease and shock at the other things that happen in thesame place, often acts thatprey on this beliefand trust in other people. I hold these two opposite extremes in tension in my mind, willing them together but feeling them reject my wishes like magnets of the same pole. The more I push, the more they pull apart.Humans are loving and gracious beyond what we think given the chance, but how can I urge everyone to trust others when there is objectively a lot to be afraid of?Here‚Äôs what I know. Societies, communities, neighborhoods can‚Äôt operate if people live in fear of each other. There will always be some people that try to take advantage of the good will of others. So how do you live with a default trust of other people while protecting yourself from those who would capitalize on that trust? You must commit to that trust and rely on support networks to catch you when that trust is violated, to live out the belief in a trust-first world.I‚Äôm not really satisfied with this answer, but it‚Äôs the best I have right now. Perhaps it‚Äôs a futile act to try to find something that can accommodate both. Perhaps being a believer in people is to embrace grace and joy along with suffering and pain. Maybe to commit to trusting in others by default, you say to yourselfyes, I am willing to suffer the times my trust is misplaced.I‚Äôve always been a people optimist. I want to believe in people. I want to believe that I still believe in people. ¬†And I can‚Äôt help but swell with hope every time I experience these moments of life and authentic humanity. I want to believe the acts of violence areinhumane, in that they are beyond the nature of humanity.That they come from states of being untrue to our fundamental nature; that they are caused by a society where people are driven away from their inherent nature because they aren‚Äôt fulfilled or taken care of or loved.Even if all this bad exists with so much good. I want to bear witness to the good. I want to honor these little, radical moments for reminding us how much beauty and vibrance is innate to us, if we are only willing toseeit. How much limitless spirit is waiting to be released into the world to converge with other yearnings of souls. How we all enter this world for a small, insignificant blip of a life, and still, there are everyday moments that feel like holding infinity in the palm of our hands.</description>

      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/ti-03-communal-websites-moss-of-the</link>
      <description>Hi all, It's been a while since my last share-out here. A few factors have been holding me back from sharing lately:the question of a better cadence for all my various output (from daily research logs Making of Prince of Persia style to posts on specific ideas and phenomena to technical explorations and prototypes)overflowing with ideas and being caught up in perfectionism for 10s of draftspersonal things and preparing for my month-long break in April (going to Taiwan and Japan!) for some dedicated rest post-CodaThese are all temporary and I am confident I‚Äôll find a rhythm to these questions that feels right. Thank you as always for sitting with my explorations and a thanks tomy sponsors for supporting mein this work.What follows will be an unedited weekly retro for what I've been up to lately and my reflections on those explorations.Since my last research update, some high level updates:launchedbulletin, the anti-todo list for reorienting attention and sitting with things that you want to linger on, for private alpha use and getting some feedback rolling in. Let me know if you'd like to try it by replying to this email, and I'll send it over!There is a lot I wish I could do with this that feels like a very dedicated and tenuous investment given a lot of the work is dependent upon (and slightly adversarial towards) large social platforms where people already spend their time. I wonder about segmenting this stuff out and just focusing on the novel interactions and directions that are more long-term sustainable and less reliant on the good will of platformsslow continuation of the"future of data"question. I haven't made much progress in terms of an active prototype but that is high on my list for next steps. I also received some wonderful advice from Steve Krouse, who has gone down this rabbit hole before and documented a lot of his journeys publicly (future of coding journal, andcompose log). His end conclusion was that this is wayyy too complicated and crowded of a space to be worth building a company about it, but that's ok because my goal is just to establish the foundation for my own intuition around the nuances of data formats and develop strong opinions about how data should be formatted for different end-purposes.communal computing provocations: I launched(we)bsite's first drop / homepage withjacky. We decided to start aseparate twitter accountfor it too that will be a long-term continuation of my"what I want the internet / software to look / feel like" thread. (we)bsite will house our continual explorations together moving forward (https://github.com/we-bsite/we-bsite). We would love to host yourinternet dream on (we)bsite, and I encourage you to submit one!I want to write my vision piece for the kind of communal computing future I imagine, concretely anchored to existing systems and metaphors in the world. This has felt hard to capture everything I find compelling and essential and has come out piece-meal, in short passionate bursts, but I feel the energy building to a rise that will see this through soon.I've been learning aboutL-systems(and a lot through my friendBhavik's tool) for creating a net art piece that I'm really excited about. It is a poetic representation of mycommunal gardening dreams and inspirationsfor the communal computing futures I care about.I readUpstream, by Mary Oliver, in a whirlwind of a week. Her words touch me so deeply in such short phrases, and I find myself grasping onto these words as I approach my computing explorations.I want to find the form of computing that helps us be more of ourselves, play and be whimsical.I want computing to empower us to not only see but also embody the "thousand unbreakable links between each of us and everything else."communal computing lab popup(name TBD): Scheming with a few others, we are manifesting a pop-up in San Francisco this summer, an interactive computing gallery (dynamicland x art gallery x public playground). I want this space to host pieces from the community that straddle the line between the digital and the physical. I want people to wander in and play with and leave their own marks on these pieces and discover themselves in conversation with people playing with the piece from the internet. I want this to have the expansiveness of Dynamicland with the community curated space of small galleries with the whimsy and public-access of playgrounds. Fundamentally, I want this to be a fun space that helps shape people's perspectives on computing, even slightly, towards one of play, community, and wonder.figuring out how to collaborate with so many cool people!Traditionally, I am very bad at responding to texts and scheduling calls are even harder for me. I am simultaneously overwhelmed by the number of things I am in the middle of scheduling as well as feeling so energized by the amount of people aligned with the things that I'm pursuing and reaching out to me from mybat call. One thing I've been experimenting with is doing long-term email threads weaving between different ideas and threads. This allows exchanging of ideas without the pressure of finding a synchronous time to call and interrupting meandering flows. Also open to more suggestions aboutWhat I'm keeping tabs on latelythe new hype thing LLMS and AIthe applications of newly accessible LLMs for helping the internet feel more like ours (and safeguard against the malicious uses of this technology). Simon Willison has shown thatLLMs will very very soonbe able to be run on any existing consumer hardware that individuals already have! This means an explosion of applications for nefarious purposes (scams, misinfo, abuse etc.), but the technology is here, and we will need to find a way (as we always do) to use it for good and the flourishing of the collective. We've already seen promising uses in simple brainstorming and generation for low-creativity applications and having a personalized tutor for any specialized field, but I want to know how this can be used as a communal technology to prompt us to reflect, develop our tastes, and find meaning in our world.creating space for us on the internetI'm spending a lot of time writing about and thinking about the common space that we share on the internet and how so much life emerges on the side (comments sections) and in corners of the internet like the moss that flowers in the cracks between the manicured sidewalks.I want each person to be able to curate their own topical feeds (text and rich media) associated with their own personal space and corner on the internet. They should be able to share here first and then have itautomatically syndicateto the huge social media platforms that give us distribution (ideally we find a new, more human way of distribution to address this).I'm continually inspired by all the ways people have co-opted existing corporate space for creating communal space for connection. I recently found this video talking about theinternet checkpoint(thankshenry!), a phenomenon of leaving intimate, personal stories on a random youtube video.I'm actively looking for more things like this. Please send if you have any recs for me!embodied computingThere has been very exciting recent developments atfolk.computerin NYC, and I also saw a setup in SF this week experimenting with imbuing physical objects with the soul of digital things, to be triggered when placed on magical altars (like playing a particular album on Spotify or opening up the chat for a friend).I want to experiment with a bunch of folk, home-cooked personal devices to this end, starting with a thermal cat printer (thanks omar) hooked up to a small server that who I can share with friends for leaving little notes that print onto my desk.That's all for this dispatch! In the same vein as the long-form email threads with individuals, I imagine this newsletter as a long-form email thread with each of you and hope you feel not only welcome but encouraged to reply to any of these things with inspirations and feelings that come up.Until next time! üß°ü™∂spencer</description>

      <title>digital playgrounds</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/digital-playgrounds</link>
      <description>A core tenet of my communal computing research is that play is essential to any healthy learning, creation, and flourishing (seeHomo Ludens). Play is fundamental to agency, the secret ingredient for creating a society where people feel empowered to express themselves and in communion with others. In addition to the standards of what you‚Äôd expect from technical research (lots of reading, practice implementing, speculating, etc.), I want to know how we can propagate the cultural change necessary for making this sort of imagination, play, and agency the expected norm.In these futures I‚Äôm grasping towards, play should feel natural, easy‚Äîas fundamental and unconscious as breathing.Playas an adjective shouldn‚Äôt even need to exist anymore because it will a part of the very nature of operating.How could our digital environments not only enable play but also push our culture towards a fundamental expectation of play as a natural and fundamental part of being?‚Äúgamification‚Äù - a warped flavor of playIn digital spaces, we've already seenplayingtake on foreboding shapes. Playing has become co-opted bygamification. When companies talk about making their product more fun and playful, they often turn to the levers popularized by addictive games and apps to promote some arbitrary sense ofprogresstowards manipulative ends. High scores, badges, leveling up, redeeming points are all applied, salves upon an unbroken wound.The methods capitalize on our dopamine-seeking brain and co-opt our attention in malicious ways. As C Thi Nguyen writes in hisstudy of games, games capture and flatten our values to the point that the ‚Äúgames are playingus‚Äù(manipulating us to chase after their designed measures of value) rather than the other way around.play as curiosity, as wayfinding, as collective discoveryInstead, the kinds of play I speak of are the magical moments following your curiosity. Play happens when you are answering the questions that your nose, eyes, mind, and senses ask of you‚Äîthe things the world and your inner self compels of you in the everyday wonder of life.I want to talk about theplayful nature of curiosity within us and communal exploration.I‚Äôve been drawn to the anchor point ofparallel play, commonly used in child psychology to refer to children playing in the the same space together, regardless of whether they are actively playingwitheach other.I think of all the wonderful emergent phenomenon that happen on playgrounds and other low-pressure communal spaces, where the environment reveals others‚Äô curiosities. For example, when you‚Äôre on the swing set, you could start matching the rhythm of those next to you, have a friendly competition for who can go higher. When you‚Äôre coworking in the same room, each tending to each others' thoughts or tinkerings or tip-tapping away at keyboards in peace, you can get the immediate feedback from the room on the idea you‚Äôre struggling with.I‚Äôm grasping towards the play that happens when you‚Äôre sitting in a cafe on a sunny spring day, there‚Äôs a vibey jam bathing the room in the swirl of possibility, and you feel yourself harmonizing with the motions of the others in the room. Where at once, you feel whole with your fullness of being and interconnected with everyone else around you.In these moments of parallel connection, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. There‚Äôs a simultaneous feeling of strong individual expression and a collective energy lifting everyone up.We know very well what these look like in physical space, so how might we imagine digital environments that enable and empower the same behavior?imagining digital playgroundsWhat might digital playgrounds look like?Places where we are not only allowed to but encouraged to play and explore in a shared space, where you have both the safety to follow your individual curiosity and the potential of merging games with the others around you.I‚Äôve recently been inspired byCas Holman‚Äôswork on imagining toys and playspaces that allow children ‚Äúto build without having to master a tool.‚Äù The core philosophy revolves around giving children access to the fundamental capabilities that real designers have (rather than ‚Äúdumbing it down‚Äù for ease) while making it as accessible as possible for experimentation and self-discovery.Although nothing in digital space quite captures the extent of Holman‚Äôs ideals, I see threads of it in end-user programming tools (e.g. those described in mycall for more agentic technology), the pockets of the internet whereemergent behaviors are normalized into ritual, large MMORPG games (Runescape, Club Penguin, etc.) with gathering areas to grow together, and the common act of curating content in themed collections, available in every social media app.top: theTuscan Milk story phenomenonwhen people first discovered how you could co-opt comment sections and reviews and bottom: a picture of a fishing spot I visited all the time in Runescape as a child, sometimes with over 100 people overlapping on the same tile to fish together.How might we imagine extended environments that empower us to play together? Some rough directions follow‚ÄîI would love for you toyes-andthese and also provoke with new directions in the comments (please co-opt them as the milk reviewers have pioneered)!1) multi-faceted ways of being together through spectrums of collaborationPlay inherently involves sharing space together, in the way that games are denoted by ‚Äúmagic circles.‚Äù In digital space, we often have to share space with each other in very extremes, binary ways: either we are shouting in each other‚Äôs ears and completely exposed in our real-time video OR we are invisible to each other.Instead of binary switches, let‚Äôs considerknobs for togethernessandspectrumsof collaboration. These continuous measures of sharing space together parallelgradients of intimacy, one of Christopher Alexander‚Äôs patterns for well-designed architecture. Like inviting physical places, our internet landscape should support multiple modalities of togetherness and offer us the ability to take actions along varying levels of pressure (e.g. from lurking to reacting to commenting to live streaming your face to the world).Rather than purelyasynchronous(traditional posting and message chats and forums) and purelysynchronousforms (collaborative doc editing, video conferencing, open-world video games) of being together, how might we imagine in-between, ambient, peripheral ways of being together?in-between forms of togethernessIn the physical world, there‚Äôs a much richer sense ofsharing spacesimply because of all the natural effects of inhabiting a space. You can tell when your roommate was working in the kitchen in the morning, if they had cooked themselves some breakfast by the pan hung to dry, the bench left slightly ajar, the half-full coffee cup forgotten on the table. Ourbeing thereis a natural effect of entropy, and it takesmore workto return things exactly to the exact same state as before. The multifaceted presence available to people makes it much safer to play by giving you the agency to choose how identifiable you want to be with your actions.The opposite is true in the digital world. There is no concept of decay (other than theoccasional bit flipwhich defies all expectations). It takesmore workto mimic the effects of decay, to enable actions to automatically produce residue. Under these constraints, how do we create morelivenessin sharing space together? What is the natural residue that our digital actions might produce?I love this exploration from Google‚Äôs Seed Studio around creating‚Äúlittle signals‚Äù.

(Philosophically, I‚Äôve found inspirationfrom tequiology, a call to reimagine technological innovation as a common good drawing inspiration fromtequio, a term to describe communal labor for common infrastructure in Mexico and with other words in other parts of Latin America.2) interactive websites that show rather than tellThere‚Äôs a greatgame design philosophy of ‚Äúshow don‚Äôt tell.‚ÄùWhen adopted right in websites, this dynamic actively encourages visitors to explore and play, and it teaches and reveals in response to this playing. Instead of prescribing a single, dominating goal, these environments nudge you, but leave the ultimate path up to you. In return, when you find something fun, surprising, or interesting, you feel ownership over that discovery. Open-ended showing in place of telling and pushing impart agency unto the visitor (now player).For example,chias.websiteencourages visitors to click around and explore because of the lack of scrolling and the whimsical design.Nick Jones‚Äô sitetransforms scrolling into a new interaction that forces you to pay attention and discover what other interesting nuggets have been hidden in the site.Ilithya‚Äôs siteis a wonderful portal into her own world. Immediately, you are forced to find your footing in this unusual landscape, where even your cursor movements trigger a different interaction than the norm. This philosophy inspired a lot of the interactions on(we)bsitetoo by embedding multiple playful interactions throughout the elements that inspire whimsy. Even opening a link is converted to dropping a letter onto a literal wooden desk rather than clicking a blue phrase.a beautiful example of how people will often find their own way to express themselves, going against the prescribed paths when the very form of the prescription feels invalid (source)It‚Äôs common to see things that feel good to other people dismissed astoys, as if they aren‚Äôt applicable in the ‚Äúreal world,‚Äù but having fun with something often leads to inventing entirely new methods of playing. I played a lot of video games growing up, and my parents never could understand how I would lose myself in them for so long. But video games have long been the source of folk ingenuity, from Super Smash Bros Melee culture andexploitstoMinecraft worlds.Simply, it should feel fun.Makingthings juicyandtexturedmay not seem like it would do much, but how somethingfeels(the soul in it) determines people‚Äôs first impressions on how they should interact with it. Rather than looking at metrics and strict plans to determine what is highest impact, this problem should be approached the same way poets and artists approach making great art. They are chasing after what viscerally impacts them.‚ÄúGame Feel taps into the human nature of performing actions that have no purpose. They just feel good.‚Äù ‚Äî from a fantastic piece on Brad Woodson Juice.What is something that you used that left a permanent mark on you? Something that felt fun to keep exploring and finding out what else the creator left for you to discover?3) what if... fundamentally more communal devices?A big obstacle to even sharing digital space is that our devices are inherently solitary. This era of technology has prized individual customization with the ultimate innovation of thepersonal computer. As a result, when we use each other‚Äôs phones, we‚Äôre disoriented by the vast differences in layouts and settings.I think this obscurity also causes a lot of the dehumanization that occurs in digital spaces, because entire people and their niche preferences are distilled down to avatars and screen names.If we knew that they kept their brightness at an overbearing 100% in the middle of the night, preferred to use 8pt font for all their apps, or texted with their index fingers instead of their thumbs, would we have more empathy for and shared intimacy with our fellow digital wanderers? I suspect yes, based on the research on theLesser Minds Problem, which demonstrates the effectiveness of subverting people‚Äôs instinctual dehumanization of homeless people by asking them ‚Äúa simple probing question about vegetable preferences.‚ÄùWhere else have you found spaces for communal play? What do you picture when you think of a digital playground? What would an ecosystem for freeform wonder and curiosity look like?If you liked this and want to support my independent research, please share it with a friend and if you have a few bucks to spare a month,sponsor me on Github!Share</description>

      <title>honoring existence</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/honoring-existence</link>
      <description>Today‚Äôs issue is dedicated to a small subscription milestone. Thank you to the 400 (!!!) of you who have subscribed to receive my writing in your inbox! The replies I receive in my inbox and the comments I happen upon give me so much joy and purpose. I read every single one (even if it takes me a longg time to reply, sometimes), so please feel very encouraged to let me know your thoughts and reflections :)I have worried about splitting my Substack audience between my personal essay writing and my research pieces (and part of that worry has kept me from posting as honestly as before), but as it stands, I‚Äôm committing to the context collapse inherent in myself and what I feel drawn to write about.I‚Äôve also been experimenting with posting more casual observations on platforms other than Twitter, like bluesky (@spencer.bsky.social) and the new substack notes. Excited to see the development of all of these alternative social spaces!A still from„ÄäÂÆúËò≠ „Äã(Yilan) by Ëî°Êòé‰∫Æ (Ming-Liang Tsai), a short film documenting the lives of people in Yilan through static shots of local storesA tightness has been haunting me lately. Sitting at the base of my throat, somewhere between my Adam's apple and collarbone, I feel a bump like a fish bone burrowing into my throat. If you don't speak for a while, one day you may wake up and find that your mouth has been sewed shut. Flooded with half-finished drafts and essays that fail to find their way to a satisfying point, my breath becomes heavier and unsteady. Time runs faster than I thought possible.I cope by going out into nature, sitting at the park, watching how the generations far from me live their lives. I seek solace in the everyday motion of these people rather than the melodramatic lives of fictional characters. A bald man stops in front of me to watch the sun set over the trees in Da'an Park. I like the way he walks, lifting his legs up to a 90-degree angle in a subtle march. A lady walks past swinging her arms powerfully, forming smooth rotating semicircles. Yesterday I watched a young girl screaming, feet lunged in the air as she sped towards pigeons, a little warrior on a tiny bike charging into battle.When I describe the things I pay attention to, the everyday moments that are important to me, I worry whether anyone else finds them interesting. I fear my inability to do them justice, to grant them the poetic diligence they deserve. Words are my tool of choice, but they often feel so lacking, like friends turned strangers. Mastery of language comes in two parts: a commitment to the soul of each word, and an intuition for how they dance together. The more my commitment grows, the more I fear opening¬† my mouth, knowing the ways my words fall short. Yet as much as I yearn to remain true to the world, every reference is a reconstruction, every story a retelling, every representation a misrepresentation. I've failed before I've even begun.So why write at all?I write to honor my existence. Not the professional achievements that make it onto a resume or in your official bio nor the big life events that could be summarized in a "facebook life update" (orcould've beenback when people still used it)‚Äîthose get enough attention‚ÄîI want to make space for the day-to-day moments that comprise a lifetime: the way the people around me move, how my friends' eyes sparkled in the reflection of the karaoke room TV, the way the sun sometimes impersonates the moon as it peeks out from under an overcast day before washing the sky in pink and orange.The writing that stays with me‚Äîthe parts I remember in the endless stream of content‚Äîare not the ones with perfect structure and bulletproof purpose. They are messy, fractured, and even contradictory. Yet at the same time, they are tender, loving,fearlessin exposing themselves to the world. They resentclear-cut boxes, demonstrateirrational belief, and dare you to come along for the ride.So here I am‚Äîtyping away at my keyboard, allowing myself to let the words flow onto this screen, as a constant droning reminds me where they fail me. Here I am returning to the altar with my pen in hand, giving myself the grace to dance with the world through language. Here I am committing to sharing these moments of the ordinary‚Äîso ordinary to be profound. So that I might not lose my voice, so that these moments will be remembered, so that at some point someone somewhere might hear these words return to them and shiver.A few recent life updates:My net art piece,html garden, is out in the 2nd issue of theHTML Review! I‚Äôve admired their work ever since their launch last year, and I‚Äôm so excited to be a part of this year‚Äôs collection along with some wonderful friends and artists. Read more about theorigin here. A funny milestone happened the other day when I tried to explain the meaning / intent behind it to a Taiwanese man I happened to share a dinner table with.I‚Äôm traveling in Taiwan and Japan this month as a real, long break from employment. I‚Äôve been in Taiwan almost 2 weeks now, and I feel so at-home and welcomed despite having no family left living here. And I‚Äôve been finding a lot of inspiration for communal digital spaces (more to come on this soon!). If you have recs for Tokyo and Kyoto (food, thrifting, fun off-the-beaten-path scenic spots), please let me know!I‚Äôm excited to be working with an inspiring crew this summer as part of theSummer of Protocols program. I‚Äôm hoping to prototype speculative protocols, explore folk protocol manifestations, and develop a deeper understanding of the shape of protocols and how they shape our environments.As a reminder that all my work is able to be free due to the generosity and support of readers like you.

      <title>finding my own time</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/finding-my-own-time</link>
      <description>Keep Changing, Connect with Everything, Continue Foreverby Tatsuo Miyajima at the Museum of Contemporary Art TokyoIt hasn't even been a week since I returned to the U.S. after a month of traveling across Taiwan and Japan (my vacation to myself post-employment), but I'm already feeling that sensation of pressure creep back up on me.What are you spending your time doing now? How do you make space for all your creative endeavors? What can you do to stop failing the people you love?It's the first time in a long time where people are asking me what I am excited about lately, and I sheepishly admit that I'm not sure? That is, if I'm in an honest mood. Otherwise, I'll recycle old answers and parade them about, earning myself a respectable number of nods and oohs and aahs, perhaps even a follow-up question or two.I feel like I'm failing at something I'm not even competing in. I'm entering myself in competitions with people who are on different timelines: the standard career ladders, the hustle of VC-backed startups, the slow but steady roll of grad school. I feel a bit lost after being so "no-computer" brain for the past month. After my reset, I think I'm finding my reason for working and creating again. I'm rediscovering why I love the things I've always said to love and the things I've committed to doing, double-checking that the same answer comes up.I know this is important work, probably the most crucial work I could be doing before rushing back into anything else, but I can't help but doubt if it's a waste of time. I feel the itch to get back into doing something thatfeelsproductive, that yields concrete output. I feel the urge work on code even if it's something that becomes obsolete in a few weeks. I want to write even if it's something that I hate. I want to feel like I'm useful.Jenny Odell inSaving Timemakes the distinction betweenchronos, the linearfungibletime we're accustomed to, andkairos, the uncertain,crisis-like time that makes change possible, that offers the world to us to shape as we like. It's the kind of time that can be unnerving because we have no control over it‚Äîone hour is not the same now versus then; we have to let go of notions ofproductivityorefficiencyin order to participate, to dance with the waves of time and open our eyes only when the music has paused.In order to embrace the idea ofkairos, then, we need to untether ourselves from the idea of linear utility, the kind that drives our desires to beproductiveandusefulalong measurable spectrums of efficiency. We must learn to embrace what the times call for, whether slow ambling and aimless wandering or hearty sprinting and fierce dreaming.How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives. What we do with this hour, and that one, is what we are doing. A schedule defends from chaos and whim. It is a net for catching days. It is a scaffolding on which a worker can stand and labor with both hands at sections of time. A schedule is a mock-up of reason and order‚Äîwilled, faked, and so brought into being; it is a peace and a haven set into the wreck of time; it is a lifeboat on which you find yourself, decades later, still living. Each day is the same, so you remember the series afterward as a blurred and powerful pattern.-fromThe Writing Lifeby Anne DillardWhile traveling, it felt like I had exitedchronosto enterkairos. Traditionally unemployment is a good way to swap from the former to the latter, but after leaving my software engineering job in January, I naturally filled my time with "work" during traditional work hours because that was what I was used to. But a vacationer's time is one of abundant possibility. You exist outside of the schedules of the people you are surrounded by.1The role offers you the possibility of transformation.This time I did the most minimal planning before going on my trip. I booked my flight and (most of) my lodging in researched neighborhoods and figured out what felt right when I was there, catering each day to the evolving weather and how much energy I had. This meant if it suddenly rained, I could decide to visit the museum and find some food and adventuring near there. Every day felt like possibility, and in tandem, I met so many spontaneous new friends through my wanderings that I might not have had the space to talk to if I was on a tight schedule. I zoomed through winding cliffside roads on an electric scooter, watched tai chi groups in the park, biked through the empty early morning streets of Taipei. I wandered freely, my idea of the day of the week or time of day governed only by the position of the sun and the density of young people in the streets.Coming back, I feel the molasses around my muscles‚ÄîI'm steeped in kairos. I'm still tired each day even after sleeping 8+ hours, and the uncertainty is bubbling up around my ears. I don't feel that surge that powers me through midnight coding sessions. It feels hard to breathe. My pulse is slow. As much as I want to go back to the same me from a month ago, my body doesn't cooperate. I feel called to question and meander and burrow. To find a safe place to dwell, first and foremost.I'm scared of my own agency, of achievement, of having all the power to make everything that I want to happen happen. I'm scared of going into the zone at the edge of my comfort, to push myself to make an internet research lab, to become an established net artist, to create community around creative, inviting, playful technology and the little things in everyday life that capture our soul. My mind is far from computer mode, and I worry about whether I can become that person again (Iwillmyself to become that person again).I wake up in an apartment near Alamo Square to the light streaming through the bay windows. I see the top of Sutro Tower on one end, watch the clouds on their eternal journey across the blue blue sky. I think about how lucky I am to have this time for myself, how privileged I am to have escaped the tendrils of fungible, capitalist, hyper-optimized time, even if for a short while. I don‚Äôt have to know what day of the week it is or wear a watch giving me a 5-minute warning before my next meeting. I can listen to my environment: watch the sky‚Äôs color and the sun‚Äôs degree, notice how crowded my local coffee shop is and how densely packed the street is. I can eat when I‚Äôm hungry, wander when I‚Äôm restless, dig into a rabbit hole when curiosity swallows me whole. This sense of time is a rare gift, and I plan to savor each tiny moment.This discomfort oozes with possibility. I don‚Äôthave toget back to anything, and neither do Ideserveanything. To begin, I must believe. To believe, I mustworld.2Whatever happens, however my body's time compels me, I don't want to stop moving, to stop creating, to stop dreaming. My hands crave a reason. I ammoving forward, step by step, minute by minute, moment by blistering moment.For more inspo, see thisare.na channel on timeby my friends and I.1Notably just traveling as a tourist to a new place does not automatically mean you start to operate inkairos. The kind of vacationing that is popular now consists of itineraries stuffed full with bucket list items, top 10 lists, and viral TikTok recommendations, sometimes with precise minute specifications for where you need, how you need to look, and what you need to feel. This kind of traveling can be an even more extreme example ofchronoscompared to people's normal working lives. To embracekairoswhile traveling you have to take the approach of the wandering visitor: someone who is inhabiting a new place and follows their nose for what feels right in every moment.2I like searching for happy endings, so perhaps this is just one more delusion to push me back to functioning in my expertise‚Ä¶ but isn‚Äôt so much of life delusions and religion-making?</description>

      <title>[TI-04] gestures at alternative internets</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/ti-04-gestures-at-alternative-internets</link>
      <description>Yesterday, a website of mine,html garden, was installed on an outdoor patio fora live event. I wasn't there in person but received pictures of people using it as a backdrop for their photos or simply standing in front and watching it move. While I don't make websites for the purpose of being displayed in real life‚ÄîI make websites as a desperate act to create intimate gathering spaces, one that internet natives might find and sit for a while‚Äîit feels like a different kind of meaning to see the pixels and bits you crafted translated into a site of communion, contemplation, and wonder.html garden as an outdoor gardenI've been thinking about how to weave my art practice into my research and engineering practice. I've been talking to friends in similar positions about their approaches to get a better idea.Atalks of smooshing them all together into one giant blob that is her.Cfeels that nothing should be compromised, that you should embrace every single identity you feel compelled by and live every moment fully seated in them. I've been visualizing it as weaving different braids for each, adopting new knots that fit, and learning to interweave them in a single quilted strand: interdependent yet whole in themselves.My entire research and art practice involves creating technology (tools, public infrastructure, instruction manuals) and internetsites(places, dinner parties, neighborhood libraries) that highlight the humanity shining in every seam of the computers we use and the materiality of these invisible bits and pixels. I want to subvert the overwhelming understanding of technology as an oppressive force pushed by large technology platforms and apps that feed on our attention to survive. I want to create space for real dialogue between the human and the computer, where computing is a medium for people to express themselves, cherish others, and create the possibility for imaginative change. I want to make computers feel like feelings, as Tim Hwang and Omar Rizwan claim: "For us, computer is the specific feeling of artifacts that allow for intimate systems of personal meaning."a snippet from "A Computer is a Feeling"With any speculative research, I have found that I need to create these "art" pieces togesturetowards the kind of world / vision /thingthat I am grasping at and fumbling towards. What is takes to get there still feels very hazy, but each time I create something that is "out there," that questions and then shows "what-if", it bursts a clearing of possibility in the haze (I'm reminded of Minesweeper when you're stuck and take a gamble by clicking in unsolved space, hoping to find a clearing). I believe this kind of gesturing and speculating is essential to understanding what is really needed at the infrastructural level to produce the environment for these feelings.taken fromminesweeperonline.comhtml gardenis a garden of digital-native plants (different species composed of different HTML elements) that grow every day. On a new day, you might find new saplings or a new branch on the plant you were admiring previously. By creating space for these changes and acts of noticing, I seek to give agency to visitors to witness the passage of time and be rewarded for doing so. The garden itself also functions as a rooted gathering space, one where people may share experiences and moments in the constant transformation of the website.https://twitter.com/spencerc99/status/1643410142963335168With "html garden," I sought to create an internet place with a real-world environment. I wanted to create a "seasonal" website, one that not only changes with the seasons but also grows noticeably day-to-day. On the internet, we often seesaw between extreme permanence (deleted content getting dug up through the endless archives) and extreme ephemerality (official research and information disappeared bylink rotand entire worlds shut downby company acquisitions). I think a lot of our tension with computers and the internet is that they tend to turn everything into a binary. We are whiplashed between extreme ends, often experiencing a contradictory reality caught between both realities simultaneously.In the physical world, things move in gradients and naturally transition between states. "Permanent" artifacts arepreserved(note that this is an active action), like family artifacts and stories. There's a lineage to the permanence of an object or a place. Homes can disappear and neighborhoods can change, but they happen over the course of days and weeks and years. These aspects still apply to computing objects, but the work involved is invisible and hard to understand. As modern technology improves maybe changing the physical world will become as fast as changing the digital one, but for now, only in the digital, does it feel like, at any moment, everything you know and love could seemingly disappear from your eyes. Being on the internet feels more like a collective hallucination than anything real or material.So when I make internet sites to sit in this in-between, I am really painting a different kind of hallucination, one in which technology highlights the motions of the people around you who you're never able to notice, one that offers you markers to reference growth, decay, and change and acknowledges your radical act of close attention in a space that has never prized the quality of attention, only the quantity of it.This is but one gesture toward an incomplete picture. I would love to hear about the gestures you've made or seen that have helped you burst into a new possibility space of thinking around what the internet and computers can or should be. Please email or message me!Here are some pieces that I've come across lately that rhyme..The Computer is a Feelingby Tim Hwang and Omar RizwanThe Creation Myths of Computingby Chia Amisolaon wasting timeby L.

      <title>[TI-05] html energy and human webs</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/html-energy-and-human-webs</link>
      <description>After hosting the bay area meetup forhtml.energyto make websites over the weekend, I've been thinking about the question ofwhat is html energy?&lt;humans&gt; tag,see moreOmar, in his brief letter about html energy, described it as a series of more likes and less likes: like using old, deprecated tags is more and loading javascript from another file is less. Generally, I found that people with some experience making websites have a pretty good sense of this. They understand that handwritten html is more like it than dynamically inserting content or using a build system. Or that using inline styles is more like it than creating a strict ‚Äúdesign system.‚Äù I like this way of trying to define it precisely because it doesn‚Äôt yield a strict definition. It is valuable because of how imprecise it is. It's open to immediate (and not so rigorous) interpretations and intuitions.There‚Äôs this sense that this kind of energy is ‚Äúpure.‚Äù In that what people create is innocent and derived from authentic desire. There is no ‚Äúend‚Äù other than to create something interesting, fun, and/or worthy of banter. I‚Äôm noting as I write this that I changed my initial word choice to ‚Äúbanter‚Äù from ‚Äúdiscussion.‚Äùhtml energyfeels less intellectual (book club) and more spiritual (full moon gathering). It feels less about arguingforor even exploring any particular idea, and more about sitting with a particular feeling. I felt weird making theportal sitefor the meetup because I decided to useVite and Typescriptfor it (a preferred choice and also for the efficiency of creating links for each page..). I had a hazy vision that this site would be a place where people from each individual meetup location could personalize, in the same way that open google docs offer empty space for expression1. I pictured every link taking on a unique personality of the city turning the whole site into a mismatched house, full of random yet priceless trinkets.I wanted each link to each page to slowly grow a personality of its own that represented each city. For each templated link to become feral through the actions of people. I wanted this gathering place to be an exercise inwilding.In the end, I don‚Äôt think anyone actually added to the portal outside of me, partly from the overhead of coordination and mostly, I suspect, from the inaccessibility of editing. What I really wanted was to be able to share the website open to "anyone with the link" rather than needing to individually invite everyone as a collaborator to the Github repository. Github is not so much "html energy," so this kind of thing is not supported (and what kind of enterprise would have this request?). "html energy" also feels more like grassroots community gatherings rather than strictly organized meetups, more like small informal groups than hierarchicalbusinesses, people who just want to have fun than people trying to optimize every part of their life.Sites with "html energy" feel poetic. They feel personal and sometimes disorienting or uninviting. They are rife with clues about the texture of the maker. They offer a path for someone to create space for themselves or something they care about online. They point to the kind of internet that I want to spend more time in‚Äîthe kind that feels like people doing what they do best: being people.I've been grasping toward more ways for people to express this kind of energy on the internet. How can poetic sites and single-purpose websites feel more like what you would expect from spending a quarter hour traversing the internet, rather than the flood of information and the push and pull of algorithms? How can I take a stroll through a place full of these and live by a forest full of html energy, with countless trails that give me the space to become more intimate with another's energy?One ideaJamieand I were tossing around the other day is how we might make the web feel more alive. Specifically, how can digital spaces more naturally imbue presence, in the same way that you can't help leaving a mark in the physical world (unless you do the work to remove it), whether it's your footprint in the dirt, your empty bowl by the sink, or the impression in the pillow. The idea we were exploring was a library you could add via a script import that brings HTML elements to life with this presence using special attributes.For example, you could imagine ancan-moveattribute that you can add to any HTML element that allows it to be moved by anyone and that state is preserved for everyone. Or acan-drawattribute that allows you to scribble on top of it. Or acan-ageattribute that causes it to fray at the edges based on how many people have interacted with it.https://twitter.com/xhfloz/status/1653740562648821760?s=20the same vibe as what mmm.page is doing here... but persistent and collaborative?This kind of infrastructure feels like it gets very close to what I was gesturing at with the(we)bsiteI made withJacky, except it generalizes some of the interactions we made into a very easy syntax.The main unresolved challenge in my mind is: where will all this state live? the easiest thing is to provide free storage for this, but it brings up problems of defense against abuse while staying as accessible and easy to plug in as possible. Ideally, users could have the state persist directly to their website or a data storage that they own.. If you have thoughts or want to riff on this, let me know. For now, I think there‚Äôs enough there that it‚Äôs worth a prototype..1see theParty in a Google doc</description>

      <title>taking the time to see</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/taking-the-time-to-see</link>
      <description>Train at Night in the Desertby Georgia O‚ÄôKeefeI'm sitting in Le Phin, one of my favorite cafes in New York. The past few weeks have been hard. I feel like I aged several years in the process. I've been house hunting, flying between Seattle and New York and soon back to camp in the woods to talk about abetter web. I've been more scatter-brained lately than ever before, losing track of where I left things from one minute to the next, switching between tasks and topics like a moth caught between a million fireflies.I've felt pretty insecure about my answer to the question of "what have you been up to" lately.Existing? Living? Adulting?is what I would like to say, or the series of answers that automatically cross my mind. I come up with some answer that weaves ideas that have now grown weeds without the proper care and attention.Yesterday, I was talking to H, who is also on a new independent journey, about our dreams and questions and creative yearnings, and it made me wonder how long would it actually take for me to answer / fulfill all of these in a satisfying way? Originally, when I started on this journey, I had thought that finishing my original rough list of bullet point questions would mark the end of this independent period. I thought 6 months would be enough time to at least get to some sort of new confident answer or direction for all of these musings, but diving into research has been much more than I expected. It‚Äôs no wonder that people spend 4-6 years focusing on a single area of research or entire lifetimes on progressing the knowledge of a given field.the original bullet point list of questions from myannouncement postThat hopeful na√Øvet√© didn‚Äôt forsee how many new questions would pop up with every new question that I answered, how trying to answer even seemingly simple questions like: why do people collect? quickly become knotted. With my research, it felt like trying to slay a proverbial hydra. Even after all this, I hesitate to form opinions on the core questions that have kept me going. I‚Äôm naturally disinclined from forming hard opinions on things, but maybe I should be pushing myself to do so continuously. Of course, when I talk to people, I can see how much my collective knowledge and thesis has grown. I can feel the natural rush of energy and conviction growing, where before there were only strong yearnings with less substance to speak to them.Separately, beyond research,livingsurprisingly takes a substantial amount of work. After a nudge from ML and in the absence of capitalist achievement-driven dopamine, I‚Äôve been trying to feel more fulfillment from the simple acts of existing that have become so radical now: learning the names of the plants and animals that catch my eye, sitting with the sensation of wind and sun and moon, appreciating how people can be so naturally loving, careful, and funny and how the world dances with abandon‚Äîall the time‚Äîeven when you‚Äôre not looking.a tiny yellow bug that found its way to my handI‚Äôd like to give myself the permission to fill my time with attending to the things and people I love, to obsess over the things that call to me with a primal gravity, to find joy &amp; deep satisfaction in the everyday moments, in which, life frequently, stubbornly announces itself.As my internal churning wrap up in the next couple weeks and I‚Äôm able to settle into a new home, I feel a renewed sense of hope and excitement to tend properly to all the things calling to me. I still want to make gathering places. I still want to make things that make people feel something, that help people to pause and reflect and tend to what they care about. I still want to make tools and infrastructure that empower people to create what they want to see in the world. I want to make the strata for ‚Äúfuturing‚Äù (borrowing from H and Le Guin)andmaintenance and care. We must be able to imagine radically new futures while still nourishing our existing ways of living and relating to one another.I‚Äôm also reminding myself that I‚Äôm building apractice, not a career. This year Icommitted myself to cycles and nurturing rituals, and so I should dedicate myself with as much vigortowards gentle livingas I used to towards climbing a career ladder or building a product I care about or bringing an art piece vision to life. I keep reminding myself that the privilege to have this time is a responsibility to stay true to it, and not give in to the scarcity mindset of the corporate grind.I thought about why I‚Äôm doing all this at all. I tried to interrogate myself with the ‚Äú5 why‚Äôs‚Äù for this entire journey. Why am I doing independent research?Because I felt burnt out and I want to have the freedom to do whatever calls to me.Why am I focused on computers and art and the internet?Because I want people to feel things and love computers the way I love them and love each other through computers.Why do I care about this?Because they gave me a source of hope when I felt like I had no one to connect to.Why do computers give me hope?Because they reflect all of humanity. Because they would be nothing without people. Because they resonate with alight energy of potentialthat offers the world. Because they offer a place where everyone can explore freely and find others who care about the same things they do.https://twitter.com/spencerc99/status/1669543931829186561visa gave a great prompt that was a natural follow-up to this introspectionI think I should maybe revisit this motivation every month, to remind myself why I‚Äôm doing this in the first place, and that I deserve to go atmy own pace. Georgia O‚ÄôKeefe says ‚ÄúTo see takes time.‚Äù As long as I can answer the question ‚Äúam I practicing a way of being I love?‚Äù positively every day, all that‚Äôs left is to keep moving‚Äîlistening to the voice in my heart and making, gesturing, grasping at the fuzzy dreams‚Äîclarifying them one pixel at a time.recent updatesabunch of internet ppl gathered in a park to write html!i signed a lease in SF again! excited to settle in for the year and spread roots after many many months of sporadic migratinglet me know if you‚Äôll be at DWeb camp?If you liked this and want to support my independent research, please share it with a friend and if you have a few bucks to spare a month,sponsor me on Github!</description>

      <title>[TI-06] people and computers</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/ti-0-people-and-computers</link>
      <description>Today is a beautiful day in San Francisco. Outside my windows, I see a large linden tree, flush with green. Salesforce Tower looms in the distance above lived-in brick roofs. I look at the patterns the light draws on my floor, shadows slow-dancing with time.Lately, I've been making my way throughHalt and Catch Fire, a series that weaves through the personal computer revolution from when the concept of having one was just becoming normalized to the early days of the World Wide Web.1HCF feels like a more grounded, historical alternative toSilicon Valley, the other, more notable series that satirizes the culture of working in tech in the Bay Area. Instead of focusing on making fun of crazy valuations, tech bro culture, and CEO savior complexes (all of which are present without being the main thing), HCF models itself off the real stories in the development of these technologies which have dramatically shaped so much of our expectations for what computers are. Without going into too much detail and spoiling things, season 1 followsCompaq's journey to make the first portable computer, season 2 shows the beginnings of "social networks" and multiplayer video games, season 3 and 4 take us to the precursors to the age of the internet as we know it.A few weeks ago I attended DWeb Camp, which turned out to be a sort of real-life, modern-day continuation of the show. Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, was present, along with many other OGs of the industry, who were working in the heat of it as the nascent field turned into an uncontrollable phenomenon. Both honored the memory ofAaron Schwartzand posed questions about how computers couldhelpus to make, play, and find meaning and connection rather than the opposite. Everyone shared a seed of hope in the vision that computers could be a medium for being more human, and more ourselves than we could do on our own.Under this influence, I'm reflecting on my own hope and vision for how I want computing to feel...I care about people and computers and the internet. People I met on the internet through my computer gave me a lifeline when I felt devoid of drive and desire. I think it's a shame that everyone has a super powerful computer in their pocket now, but the device is completely personal. Screens have become demonized for all the harm they bring: addiction, misinformation, unfulfilling connection. But I've known them for all the joy, fulfillment, intimacy, and creative expression they can bring. I want to help imagine a world where our default computing infrastructure supports these kinds of desires, where the internet, by default, feels like a place inhabited by people, not slick corporate websites, ads, SEO-ified blogs and clickbait, where it feels like a medium and infrastructure for sharing space together, discovering ourselves, and pushing for better worlds. I care about the computing that...allows people to gather aroundcan be held and interacted with and impacted. that is shared together, used to play together, a source of fun observing other people playinggives each person some individual meaning in their own relationship but every one ties together into a larger canvas of communal meaningacts as a collective artifact for communities, allows people to impress themselves upon it, to shape it to their love in the same way a space shapes to the people that inhabit itenables and empowers and hold space for, the kind that gives safety to tinker and explore and co-playI care about computing that feels light, everyday, and inviting, that holds people together like light glue, that offers the possibility of coming together where you wouldn't expect. Cozy enclaves of shared data. Open rooms with lots of natural light and all the people you love and have yet to love strolling through at all hours of the day. A space to be breathless, a gap to marvel at the awe of being alive, an excuse to wonder whatmight be.originally formulated in response tovisa's questionI'm curious what this brings up for you. What is yourdream for the internet?I've been tinkering with a few things that aim to make computers and websites more like places for us to share space.playhtml: an open-source library for magically creating collaborative interactive HTML elements that persist their state across sessions.archipelago: a set of tools for interlinking, referencing, and overlapping within a webringI was on the committee forTiny Awards, an award to honor websites of the small, playful, heartfelt web. I encourage you to take a look through the selection and if you feel so inclined, vote for the ones that make you feel seen.If you have any references that you think might be helpful in this realm or are curious in trying any of these out, please let me know! I'm actively looking for people to try outplayhtmlparticularly and want to hear people's opinions on the kinds of experiences they wish they could share on websites.One recurring theme throughout HCF is this tension between living for your vision and living for others. The main characters go through successive phases of losing themselves in their work and losing themselves in their love. Do you love computers or do you love people? Do you make your dream come true, or do you dedicate yourself to the people you love?Looking at the past, I find myself scavenging energy from these predecessors of dreaming (both fictional and real) in their gentle but persistent hopes in a different world. I see so much of myself (and all of my friends, peers, advisers, and broader community of people whocare about and believe in the internet and computers as a fundamentally human technology) in their early struggles of articulating why theycare so muchabout something that seems so silly, weird, and perhaps even worthless to a lot of the world.I find myself coming up against this question and being confused by it. My dreams for the internet only exist because of all the love I have for the people in my life. I only cared about computers and the internet because of how much personal connection I found through them.Mary Oliver on dreamers, imaginers, and calling for change in UpstreamThe question feels like a false dichotomy. I think some of the most meaningful, radical change comes out of a desire to create a better worldforthe people and things we love. Dedicating oneself to the dream is an extension of dedication to those people. Some of themost impactfulpieces of literature have come out of intimate letters, made primarily for an audience of one. This belief in the translatability of the small, personal, and intimate is the same reason I believe intiny internets, homecooked software, community-garden infrastructure, personal databases,and more.Be what you are, of the earth, but a dreamer too. ‚Äî Mary OliverIn the same way thatthe particular contains the universalfor experiences, so too do I believe that our natural use of our computers and technological devices contain the future of computing. After all, computers are nothing without us. They are mediums for human expression, creation, imagination. They contain all of humanity because they are nothing more than advanced conduits for us, for our stardust and our runoff, our love and our hatred, our dreams and our deepest fears.My belief in computers and the internet reflects a belief in people, and my love for and endless curiosity of "weird web stuff" is an obsession with theeveryday gestures at possibility. The existence of weird web stuff is a testament to what andfor whocomputing can be. They exemplify how we can create change, not in a hierarchical, universal value way, but in apluriversal, grounded form of transformation. Our relationship with computers is what makes them the magical devices they are, which means we have all the power to shape them into extensions of our fullest selves, and we ought to remember: in our most ordinary actions, we reshape them every day.1Despite its relative obscurity, the show has raving reviews from viewers and critics alike, and I've been meaning to watch this show for a long time now after a recommendation from A, but it's simply impossible to watch without a very specific streaming subscription (AMC). I've finally found a reliable source now which has made all the difference (happy to share it if you message me).</description>

      <title>calm lunacy</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/calm-lunacy</link>
      <description>Black Sun by Isamu NoguchiI've been readingMadness, Rack, and Honeyby Mary Ruefle lately. It's a beautiful book in the literal sense. A pristine eggshell white cover with the wordsMadness, Rack, and Honeyin big script and the words spilling over the sides. Typeset in a beautiful serif font, it gives the light impression of awriterwhile shedding the normally intimidating air of literary books for a playful whimsy.When anyone asks me what I've been reading lately, I pay special attention to how people react as I read off the title. There's an air of mystery that provokes curiosity. All known words, simply set in a list and bunched together, and that is enough to seduce many. The name itself takes up so much space, too. It's a long title, and its weight lingers in the air when it's spoken. I tell people it's a book about poetry. I tell people it's one of the better ones.Ruefle starts off the book by saying that "all she has to say about poetry" is:"I don't think I really have anything to say about poetry other than remarking that it is a wandering little drift of unidentified sound, and trying to say more reminds me of following the sound of a thrush into the woods on a summer's eve - if you persist in following the thrush it will only recede deeper and deeper into the woods; you will never actually see the thrush (the hermit thrush is especially shy), but I suppose listening is a kind of knowledge, or as close as one can come."I want to learn how to listen. I hope this book shows me some sliver of how.In the titular chapter, Ruefle explains the title and the meaning behind each word.Honeyis the burst of joy the moment the words flow just right, when it seems like there is a container, if only for a moment, that captures the exact immensity of what you feel. And then that moment is gone, and the flies are swarming, and you're deep in therackof it, that torturous teetering between those moments of indelible satisfaction and those of frantically searching for the lost feeling.As poets1, we are junkies addicted to capturing feeling (an act of equal parts intellect and emotion). Our duty to ourselves is to commit to this unending cycle of suffering‚Äîto find heaven and exile ourselves in search of another.We cannot help ourselves. We are obsessed with the absurdity of it all. And that is themadnessof it. We cannot help but dedicate ourselves again and again to the practice of living, expressing, feeling‚Äîover and over and over again. We are seeking to be the most human we can be.Henrick Karlsson and Johanna Wiberg recently wrote aboutwhere good ideas come from. By studying the working notebooks of two creative masterminds, mathematician Alexander Grothendieck and film director Ingmar Bergman, Karlsson and Wiberg excavate the theory that good ideas need to come from solitude, where you learn "what personal curiosity feels like in its undiluted form."One of the biggest differentiators they identify is the ability to linger in the confusion of their thoughts. They are curious about their confusion, and as a result, they form the environment that allows for new questions to emerge, a skill far rarer than the ability to answer questions. This ability to sit at the "margin of society," as they call it, is what creates the opportunity to come up with new, transformative ideas.But there's a danger here that is left unsaid. If you linger too long in this liminal space, you can become lost in your own world, largely cut off from society. Many infamous extremists had the same notions of greatness and being on the edge of something new and transformative as these creative masterminds2. To bring great ideas to life, you have to balance yourself in this constant tension, simultaneously fighting the void of your mind and the pressure to conform to society.This is themadnessthat Grothendieck and Bergman undergo in their creative practices. They must constantly push against their own boundaries of expression, breaking through just to find it pop up somewhere new to repeat the process all over again.Why does life have so much suffering?is a question that makes regular visits to my mind. I think aboutdialectics, "the self-consciousness of the objective context of delusion."Dialecticsis a fancy way to refer to themadnessof living and enjoying the simplest things in a fucked up world.The other day I was talking with a mother about the conversations she has with her children when they ask about why they have to do active shooter drillers in Texas. We were walking through downtown Seattle by the water on a beautiful summer day, the sun casting each passerby in an angelic glow. The juxtaposition was terrifying and comforting.I don't know the answer to the question. I couldn't give a satisfactory one in writing if I tried. But I sometimes see glances at an answer. Often in poems. Sometimes I even write something that feels likemy answer, although usually its lifespan is short-lived, and I'm back sitting with the immensity of the question again. But for that time when everything feels like it fits together nicely‚Äîboy, does that feel good.I've been thinking about what it means to practice poetry, and I think the best answer I can come up with is that it means practicing living.I sometimes wonder how the best poets of our era spend their days. I imagine Ocean Vuong washing dishes as if it's the only thing in the universe, appreciating those singularhoneyedmoments before the inevitable lilt intorackand existential awareness of themadnessthat Ruefle speaks of. I picture how Mary Oliver starts her morning. What does she do while she waits for her coffee to brew? How many birds does she bidgood morningto?from Madness, Rack, and Honey, the bottom section on ‚ÄúThe calm lunatic.‚ÄùI think this is what Ruefle means when she mentions "the calm lunatic." We must simultaneously hold the world's contradictions‚Äîall the meaningless suffering and hate in the world with all the simple joys and rights that we take for granted. We can be less afraid of everything that we feared when we were young and more fearful than ever. We can doubt that anything happy will last, and we can believe that people are fundamentally good at heart. We can hold it all in our hearts, if we train to be strong enough to bear it.I imagine these poets practice listening to what life is saying, the scattered bits of sound that emit from the upswell of everyday activity. Their poems are collected collages of these scraps of sound.I am trying to listen. I am trying to live. I am taking a deep breath, now. I am going to sit with themadnessfor a moment longer.1How did you feel when I referred to all of us as poets? Did you feel nervous, did you push back on it, a bit angry, even? I think everyone has the capacity to be a poet. We weave poetry in the simplest moments of our life. So if that identifier felt threatening or inappropriate in any way, I encourage you to try it on for a spin for the rest of this article. What would the poetyoudo? How would they read? What does that drift of sound remind you of?2Ted Kaczynskialso had radical, transformative ideas.</description>

      <title>[TI-07] my homecooked apps</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/ti-07-my-homecooked-apps</link>
      <description>Sarah Sze‚Äôs ‚ÄúTimelapse‚Äù fromhttps://www.guggenheim.org/exhibition/sarah-sze-timelapseI‚Äôve been thinking about all the home-cooked apps I‚Äôve made for myself over the years, prompted by thiscall for them for a conference talk. Through a combination of my interest in end-user programming and passion for the poetic web, I find that I‚Äôve accumulated a large collection of tiny apps and websites, built out of very specific personal desires that have emerged. I had forgotten how many of these I had made given how long it‚Äôs been since some of them were created.A pattern I notice is that most of them are designed to archive some continuous ritual or practice. They all rely on varying custom solutions for storing and representing data. I want there to be a better way to make, curate, and maintain small collections of data. There have been many calls for this kind of thing, but little progress in the way of a new transformative solution despite how many bookmarking apps there are (and how many continue to pop up every now and then).ilove livingnoteThis originated from me repeatedly being intimate with this feeling of overwhelming gratitude for being alive and wanting to create a time capsule to preserve these feelings. It started off as just recording the date and time and leaving me space to write a little note about it, and increasingly I added more and more metadata to capture as much of the surrounding context as possible to ‚Äúbottle‚Äù up this feeling. I added the location, front and back camera photos (BeReal style), and I really wanted a way to capture the surrounding snippet of audio (in the same way Live Photos do) but that wasn‚Äôt technically feasible.I turned it into an iOS shortcut so I could run it from my home screen and also just tell Siri to run it by saying ‚Äúi love living‚Äù so it was as easy as possible for me to capture without detracting from the moment.Let me know if you want to use this and I can share the shortcut?a screenshot of my notewall of windowsI made a wall of windows to create the space for collecting vignettes of my life and showing the latest ones on a website. I found that having an explicit ‚Äúcollection‚Äù for different kinds of things prompted me to add more to them. This rings true for when I started usingare.nafor the first time. After a little over a year using it, I‚Äôve collected so many things that I can refer back to (even if the search is not the best..). The in-moment act of saying ‚Äùthisis interesting, and it falls underthisbroad umbrella of things I‚Äôve been thinking about‚Äù creates a little wedge in my brain that makes merememberI found that thing all those months ago. All I need is the wedge to be able to rummage through all my digital drawers, paths, and traces to find what I was looking for.The site for displaying the windows was also an experiment in an ephemeral kind of social network. It rewarded people for revisiting the site because you couldn‚Äôt access the full archive of images, only the latest ones. I wanted to see what it would feel like for a site to live, breathe, and change as I did in real-time.I ended up extending this wall to be open to the public (guests) to submit their own life vignettes, and I ended up hosting snapshots of life from all over, from sunsets in bangkok to old game consoles, to airy treehouses. I made a tiny little social network that worked to share some intimate photos for a little bit.bulletinBulletinstarted off as a thought around how we could create subversive tools that enable us to better control our attention online. It evolved into an ‚Äúanti todo-list,‚Äù a ‚Äúsofter Anki,‚Äù and an embedded feed inside social media feeds that served meaningful things that I want to remember (poems, pictures, and quotes).It‚Äôs on the backburner right now because I found that the current form is lacking something that makes it feel really good to use. I find that I get used to it and start scrolling immediately past it‚Ä¶ Maybe it was because I was being exposed to too much old stuff because my bank of things to remember wasn‚Äôt that big? I also find that there was an inherent tension with the attentionrequiredof the things that I want to remember (usually dense and attention-intensive) and the kind of attention I wanted to spend when I was going to social media sites. This might work better if I focused on only image-focused / audio-focused media or pulled from a much larger repository of data (including things from friends that I might care about, maybe are.na channels that have a bunch of content that I don‚Äôt want to consume immediately?)fits streamThis project was an experiment in personal data archival for a practice I started of taking a picture of my outfit every day. I initially started doing this in a Twitter thread, but I didn‚Äôt like how that spammed my existing timeline. Ultimately, I wanted a place I could store the data that could easily extend into new interfaces for showing the data and a mostly automated method that built off of my existing practice (of uploading it to an iCloud album). So I embarked on a quest to make my own data archival repository (namedreservoir). This relies on a script that I run on my computer to extract photos (and corresponding metadata) from my ‚Äúfits üß¢‚Äù album, uploads the photos to an S3 bucket, dumps the metadata into afits.jsonfile hosted on my website, and I render all the fits atfits. In the end, I effectively have my own data pipeline and warehouse just for my fits! Ideally, I wouldn‚Äôt even have to run the script, but unfortunately, programmatic access to Apple Photos is terrible.personal status apiI‚Äôm reflecting that a bunch of these tiny apps were made in order to enable some ‚Äúlive‚Äù widget on my website. My status API is an API that returns some of my latest activities, captured from different data sources. This ends up powering the marquee on my personal website, showing my latest activity.the marquee onhttps://www.spencerchang.me/sample API responsefrommeI really like the idea of collecting all your digital activity traces so you can do fun things like look back on where you were running a year ago or that you visited the link you‚Äôre on now X months ago.For a long time, I wanted to make an app that was a personal digital panopticon so you could look back on exactly what traces you left doing things on your computer a year ago (e.g. this Github commit, liked this Tweet, lingered on the comment on this Youtube video). Even thoughRewindhas shown the technological innovation needed to make this technically feasible, in practice, I found it way too noisy. I want my personal panopticon to only record the things that I express some sort of revealed preference for (I liked it, I saved it, I highlighted some words on it and copied it, I started typing a reply but didn‚Äôt send it, etc.). There are so many actions we do on our computers thatshowthem what we are thinking about and find intriguing, and there‚Äôs so much more they could do with that information in deciding which bytes are important.website screenshot archiveI made thisnet-shotsrepo to archive a bunch of pictures of my website. It uses theshot-scrapertemplate created by Simon Willison. The impetus for this shares a lot with the previous one. I wanted to create something that could create a daily archive to record the legacy of the website and how it evolves over time, like a selfie-a-day tool for your digital spaces. I tinker a lot with my personal website (and the window site also updates often), so this is an add-on tool for a lot of these ‚Äúliving‚Äù websites that can document that change over time.Up until now, I gave up on making it properly archive everything as opposed to just having the latest picture in the Github repo but finally for this post made it so that it uploads a copy to S3 every time it takes a snapshot. I guess ideally it would recognize if it was duplicate by doing a diff pass over the existing image (so if anyone would like that pls make a PR so I can take advantage too). Excited to see how this archive develops a year from now.expense trackerI may have the most elaborate personal finance app that is only built for one person. Effectively I‚Äôve made my own YNAB / Mint in order to keep on top of my finances. I have ascriptI run every month that leverages access codes to banks accessed via Plaid to upload transactions as rows into a Coda table. I‚Äôm able to triage all my transactions through this interface, categorize them, and chart data against different time scales to evaluate how my spending and earning are evolving over time (especially helpful in this funemployment stage of life). I can create custom tags for different events (like trips or furnishing my house, etc.) so I can keep track of how spending is evolving over time for those things that span many different categories. And I can map out reimbursements so I make sure I didn‚Äôt forget to split large charges.from thistweetA lot of people have asked me if they can use this tool. The problem is that it uses so many custom-built quirky systems that I now have a trained mental muscle for operating which would be very confusing under traditional interface standards. For example, for some reason, I decided that positive numbers would be expenses and negative numbers would be income early on. I also delete credit card payment charges (and the respective bank transfer transaction) because they don‚Äôt provide any new or extra information. And because I also include Venmo as an import source, I delete any transactions titled ‚ÄúVenmo‚Äù from my bank because they would double count the transaction when it pulls directly from the account to pay. There are all these weird practices I do that are now normalized because I don‚Äôtneedto fix these things in order for it to work for me.misc smaller thingsclipboard saver: automatically archiving the things I copy on my computer into a.csvfile via an app called Maccy, another form of archival of the everyday actions we do in digital space.text assistant / poetry bot: a collective poetry bot that posted to poetry.bsky.social whenever someone texted me (each person could specify their signifying stamp as a pseudonymous form of authorship)poem called love: an interactive version ofalex dimitrov‚Äôsperpetual poem‚Äúa poem called love‚ÄùWhat homecooked apps have you made?

      <title>two questions</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/two-questions</link>
      <description>Construction (Âª∫Ë®≠) by Fan Ho (1957)Something I learned from R lately is how he has evaluated success on his independent journey. He only looks to the answers of two questions: who am I and what do I want? As long as the answers to those questions are developing, time is being spent well.This whole independent journey has basically been me getting to know myself and what I want to do. I have the strangest days, which would sound absolutely crazy if I was still working a corporate job. For example, today, I woke up at 8:30 to get ready for a meeting to talk about ‚ÄúNew Time Machines‚Äù at 9:30. I took this meeting walking to the bus stop because I needed to go down to Bayshore to Recology‚Äôs headquarters, the waste management company that serves all of San Francisco, to attend their Artist-in-Residence tour. I spent two hours there seeing what people have done with the waste of the city to make art and will never forget walking through the Public Disposal Area (PDA for short). All over the grounds of Recology, you‚Äôll find the most unique combination of fixings, from statues that span the cultural gamut to Bauhaus-style furniture in bold colors with the paint peeling on one side to a giant robot and his friends: a huge chipmunk (perhaps Alvin?), a stormtrooper, and what appears to be the decapitated head of a Ken doll. After, I took the bus home, made lunch, and put the final edits on a piece for several hours (I‚Äôm slow at editing). I took a break to work out and then started working on a project that involves the physical design of bags. I foraged around my room for different found objects that could be refashioned into various kinds of pouches. I made one out of a black scarf and a mesh bag; an IKEA bucket hat, some spare shoelaces, and some tape (to be replaced with velcro), and a tiny Tupperware container that I‚Äôm still trying to figure out a nice way to attach or carry around. I made Hainese chicken rice, watched some TV (I‚Äôm rewatching Avatar the Last Airbender), and am now getting ready for bed.the entrance of the PDA, featuring said large robot and chipmunkWho am I? What do I want?You could‚Äîdo‚Äîspend a whole lifetime answering these questions.I haven‚Äôt really known how to answer the questions lately. I‚Äôve been restless, questioning the purpose of my work. I know I can probably never be a hotshot VC-raising-courting startup founder raising millions in a pre-seed round. I can‚Äôt put on the act of feeling unwavering faith in everything I do constantly. Instead, I‚Äôm constantly questioning everything. I‚Äôm interrogating whether things are good enough, whether they go far enough, whether the vision is compelling enough, whether the world I care about is possible in my lifetime. I‚Äôm all too aware of the difficulties I face and the uncertainty entrenched in every step of the way. I‚Äôm confronting the void, and coming out the other side every day.I‚Äôve been feeling the pressure of urgency again, wanting to accomplish all my ideas in the shortest amount of time. I suppose this stems from my obsessiveness with completion, preciously reflected in binging games or shows or even songs. I like flirting with ideas. I like trying on different hats. I have too many lives I want to live simultaneously (doing an artist residency at Recology, starting an indie software studio, making things thatfeel like magic to people, making poetic websites, returning to a ‚Äúregular‚Äù job just to avoid facing the void so constantly). And then when it feels like my head‚Äôs about to burst, I take a few deep breaths and recenter myself. And I return to a gratitude for even being able to have such a strange day such as this. I‚Äôm stuck in a cycle of manic ideas and existential angst and overwhelming gratitude. It feels a bit like trying to get 100% completion on the video game that is life. But the more paths I travel down, the more stories unravel. The deeper I get the more I find I don‚Äôt know, haven‚Äôt done, likely won‚Äôt ever get to do.In just the past 7 months, the answers to these have changed so many times (sometimes in the span of days or even hours!) that it intimidates me just to look at them. ‚ÄúChange‚Äù isn‚Äôt quite the right word here‚Äîit‚Äôs more like ‚Äúevolved‚Äù or ‚Äúdeepened.‚Äù I‚Äôm gaining an awareness of how precise of a language I crave when I talk about this stuff, which makes my existing explanations feel insufficient. In this cycle, I‚Äôm obtaining precision in talking about who I am and what I want. It feels both deeply satisfying to have atastefor what feels right but also unnerving to have to constantly interrogate myself and my language.But if I really dig into it, I don‚Äôt think what I want has really changedthat muchfrom what I wanted as a child (although I might have fancier and more detailed ways to express it now).I want to make the world better in some way, I want to help people, and I want to surround myself with people I love. And I want it to be fun.So who am I and what do I want to do?I am aprogrammer, aresearcher, acomputational poet, anartist, and awriter. I make things that inspire play, provoke connection, and empower creativity.I want to make theinternet more human-first. I want to make computers thatmake you believe you can believe in computers again. I want to make an internet that does the same, the kinds of software that give hope, spark curiosity, and enable daydreaming.Well actually that‚Äôs not true, or at least, not the whole of it. I am a noticer of the world. I am a friend, a partner, a son, a collaborator, an oxygen sink, a sun enjoyer. I am someone who enjoys sitting with the unknown, sipping water, tools for wonder, evocative writing, watermelon on a hot day, and much more (see thenon-exhaustive list on my website). I am someone who loves the world and wants to believe that I can love everyone who‚Äôs in it, too.I want to be a good human. I want to honor the world for all the beauty, wonder, and capacity latent in it. I want to love, deeply. I want to scream at the top of my lungs. I want to feel like if I was the last human alive, I‚Äôd be doing the rest of the race some justice, honoring their memory. I want to be petty when I feel like it, to laze around and scroll my hundreds of feeds and laugh at the absurdity of it all in the comments of my algorithmic neighborhood. I want to sit at the top of a park dotted with others sitting and kneeling and leaning and think about absolutely nothing, just letting the sun setting into the city and the very human sounds of existence around me seep into my soul.‚ÄúEmbrace both the bitter and the sweet that come with working from the heart, working with one‚Äôs very life on the line. I live, I take pleasures where they are afforded. Everything starts from embracing life itself.‚Äù‚Äî Yohji Yamamoto inMy Dear BombAll that I do, I do tohonorsomething. Everything I make is anodeto somethingor someone else. My websites arelove letters,thank you notes, anddedications. My life is simply me saying ‚ÄúI want to remember this‚Äù on loop.I‚Äôm primarily interested in making things out of the things we already have, to highlight new ways of looking at, talking to, and working with the stuff already in our daily lives. I used to be interested only with the frontier, thecutting edge. I wanted to invent things that defied people‚Äôs expectations. That feeling of discovery and magic upon encounter is still one of my favorite feelings in the world, but I‚Äôve shifted where I seek it out. Rather than making an entirely new world for people and forcing them to move, I care about giving us the ability to make our own worlds and care for the world we share.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs actually very hard work. You must see and think all the time. You have to think how to surpass your past work with a new angle or a new style or a new feeling. You must use your heart to determine that decisive moment which Henri Cartier-Bresson talks about. You must get the feeling and get a response from the subject you are shooting.At that moment you must care, breathe and love the universe‚Äì it‚Äôs not just about making a beautiful picture. I put my whole life into a single photograph.‚Äù‚Äî Fan Ho in aninterview(bold mine)I don‚Äôt know what the future holds‚ÄîI‚Äôm still figuring out what the next few months look like. But I know that as long as I can follow in Fan Ho‚Äôs footsteps and strive to put my whole life into the things I make, I‚Äôll be answering those two questions, and that‚Äôs plenty for me.Thank you for everyone who is reading this, and welcome to all the new folks (now 500 of you!!). If you‚Äôd like to support my work, I‚Äôd appreciate if you shared anything I‚Äôve made that resonates with someone who you think would enjoy it (and I also have asponsors pageif that‚Äôs your thing)! I have a couple exciting things coming out soon that I can‚Äôt wait to show you all :)Edit: I rewatched this ATLA episode the night after I sent this. What are the odds!?</description>

      <title>[TI-08] aliving the web</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/ti-08-aliving-the-web</link>
      <description>from top left to bottom left to right: 1) Ralph Breaks the Internet (source Vox) 2) Runescape marketplace text art advertising (source) 3) Club Penguin's Dance Club (source The Verge)I want to make the web feel alive.So often on the web, we feel alone‚Äîjust our cursor in the big world wide web. Even though it's already teeming with life with all the things we do on it, so much of what we do is hidden from each other. And that's the hope the internet gave to when people first discovered it: the people everywhere in AIM chats and on random forums and obscure wikis and in the corners of places you would never expect to have people.The web shows us that there areothersout there, like us, regardless of how niche our interests are, and their words and creations touch us. If only we could say more back to them... To share all of those rich interactions with each other, we have to expose ourselves in an entire identity and profile. We don't have the safety to express ourselves naturally in this binary space. We must choose either solitude or the spotlight, and all the consequences that come with it.I want to make the web feel alivenaturally, in a way where we feel safe to just express ourselves as richly as we already do‚Äîin the cursor patterns we form, the frenzy of navigations while on a rabbit hole, and how long we hover over each comment that makes our sides hurt with laughter.Around two months ago, I mentioned in this newsletter a new prototype I was going to be trying out something to make the web feel more alivethat embraced html energy:Specifically, how can digital spaces more naturally imbue presence, in the same way that you can't help leaving a mark in the physical world (unless you do the work to remove it), whether it's your footprint in the dirt, your empty bowl by the sink, or the impression in the pillow. The idea we were exploring was a library you could add via a script import that brings HTML elements to life with this presence using special attributes.fromhttps://twitter.com/spencerc99/status/1689359111203467271If you missed it, I made this and launched it last month! It's an open-source library calledplayhtmlthat makes the web come alive, filled with the traces of visitors, and you can play with it atplayhtml.fun. Leave a trace for me and others to find, and I'd love to see you try it out on your own sites!These small physical indicators may seem inconsequential, but they are not only signs of life but they are conduits of life itself. These little indicators of people (and rather than the general, abstract sense, I mean real, specific people!) offer themselves to us as sites of connection, and they challenge us to divine who they belong to.What I'm targeting here is a tangible sense of presence that you don't feel on websites right now‚Äîthe felt sense thatsomeonehas been here and the possibility ofknowingwhothat someone is. This rich set of interconnected interactions and presence comes for free in the physical world, where everything has a tangible presence. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be shifted around. In the physical world, objects have a body that cannot simply be disappeared (at least not easily). Everything you do leaves some trace and causes chain reactions in response. Our actions automatically create reactions, and as a result, we have a living, breathing, and unpredictable ecosystem that offers so muchrich detailfor us to pay attention to.In a digital space, the closest we get is in the ocean currents of large-scale social media. There's an organic life force here that's driven by people in the cultural trend, in the constant ebb and flow of niche reference material in whatever has become cultural canon and lore. You can pick up on a surprising amount of detail in the way people interact and the content they make in how much is referencing (and influenced by) what has been happening the past day, week, month, and even years (references to Vines, a long-dead product, still resurface now and again). However, this life force is ultimatelydirectedby the Algorithm. The "breath of the gods" (as Robin Sloan calls it) bestows cultural relevance on those it deems to fulfill their desires (of longer view times, higher engagement, etc.). We only have so much control over how the ecosystem works.Instead, I'd like to paint a different future, one which preserves the overflowing amount of life and countless number of interdependent interactions, but gives the power of shaping the environment ultimately to the participants in it. I'd call my approach something akin to the advocacy around learning from indigenous practices of livingwiththe earth, rather than trying to control it through large machinery and interventions as we have done in our physical environments. In a digital world,we are the nature. We were here before the Algorithm, and we were here before the huge platforms that purport to give us freedom. Just as we must listen to the plants, animals, and the earth in our local ecosystems in order to learn how to live in harmony with them, the Algorithm should be shaping itself according to our needs and desires, rather than trying to sweep us into the behaviors that they desire.In creatingplayhtml, I am trying to imagine a world where rich expression and shared reality are a natural and given part of our daily experience on the internet. In the same way that we have seen so many fun and unique forms of expression emerge in the shared spaces of Google Docs (cursor parking lot) and Figma (cursor high fives), I want to create the infrastructure such that this kind of organic invention of new ways to relate to each other and express ourselves is ingrained into the very fiber of using the web. We already invent new ways of relating to each other all the time while we use the internet‚Äîwe folk program our software into the kinds of spaces that we want to share together, but I want this to feel like an official and default way of using the internet, in which you are empowered to create the worlds that you want to inhabit.There's a massive challenge inherent to this direction, which is that it is completely different from people's intuitive perceptions about how the web and websites work. This is something that many of the real-time collaboration tools have had to deal with (this conflict in perception came up so much in Coda discussions as well), especially when there aresomethings that are individual and others that are real-time collaborative. How are you supposed to know which is which? I've experienced how wildly different people react to the project depending on how I show them the demo: 1) just showing them on my phone because I'm on the go and 2) having them go to the website and showing them from my browser because they can actually follow my cursor and see everything that I'm doing happen in real-time. The latter is stunning (in a non-normative way) because "normal" websites aren't supposed to work this way. And yet, I think it's worth seeing how far we can go with challenging this notion." Resonance, by contrast [with recognition] is always a dynamic event, the expression of a vibrant responsive relationship that can be seen perhaps most splendidly when a person's eyes light up. . . . [It] always refers to an occurrence between two or more subjects.I am recognized, but resonance is something that can only happen between us. Love as a resonant experience thus refers not to the fact of loving or being loved, but to the moment or moments of mutual, transformative, fluid, affecting encounter."‚Äî Harmut Rosa, Resonance: A Sociology of Our Relationship to the World, paraphrased by Jenny OdellAliving the webis about enabling resonance, hand-holding, and the ability for our souls to be touched by others. I want the internet to be the connective tissue it originally promised to be, everywhere and in more creative and original ways that are true to the inventiveness of our spirits instead of plain text and rich media.Next up on my mind forplayhtmlis making it more compatible (like using Javascript frameworks) and allowing the plug-and-play of wholesale components (like the candle or lamps on the website). The big, existential question I'm weighing is how this is different from just a better state management library (that handles the spectrum of real-time persisted, real-time synced not persisted, local persisted), of which there already exists some really nice reactive approaches that already collaborative cases via Yjs (likeSyncedstore)? My intention was to provide a more opinionated and out-of-the-box useful library, which includes some common capabilities that you would already want, but it's really hard to make these general and customizable without beingtooopinionated. I wanted this to be a communal library for capabilities andavenues for alivenessthat we all could curate together, but given that there have been no contributions other than mine, I wonder how easy it really is to not only come up with a capability but generalize it for everyone to use on their own websites.Both of these are for selfish reasons because I want both of those capabilities for projects I want to make withplayhtml(which funnily enough I think goes a long way to making the library better?). You can seeplayhtmlin action on thedemos &amp; chillsite (where I first presented this project), the recent conversation aboutdream digital spacesI had withJacky, and of course, on mywebsite. Soon (hopefully), a graveyard for a beloved site and a communal garden.</description>

      <description>Ocean Beach on a very hot day this weekIt‚Äôs been an eventful and exciting past month!html garden is showing at the DeYoung as part of the DeYoung Open. My poemI picked up a plastic wrapper todayis published inKernel Mag 3(and I got to give my first-ever live poetry reading for it!). I have another argumentative piece coming out in a publication shortly. And I‚Äôve started working with Raymond on an app for collections, a central piece of my research that I‚Äôve circled around for the past 8 months. We‚Äôre going to be exploring how we can create a fast local-first mobile client for gathering and curating collections and sharing that activity with people you care about. We‚Äôre planning for the client to be open-source and to plug into new open protocols for structured data. In practice, this means that you can have a single place that collates the data you care about across all your platforms, where the underlying data backing is owned by you. If you already have places that you love for doing this kind of activity (e.g. Are.na), then you can just use this as a configurable client for them. I‚Äôm really excited about this work because so many of my explorations around creating more human-first experiences of computing revolve around having this intimate everyday data easily available, whetherwindows into daily lives, orrevisiting the things you care about, or sharing the moments in whichyou love living. If this is something that sounds interesting to you and you‚Äôd like to try it out, reply to this email or pass along a message to me!html garden in Koret Auditoriummy poem in Kernel MagazineThat‚Äôs about all I have to share for the more concrete updates on my research today, but I have more in the works about this practice of ‚Äúcollecting‚Äù that we do in our digital spaces and how those materials feel like the fundamentalelemental materialfor relating to each other in new ways in digital spaces.Instead, for the rest of this letter, I‚Äôd like to talk about how my feelings have evolved lately after 8ish months of independent work. I hope this doesn‚Äôt sound ungrateful in light of all the achievements that I shared earlier (which I still can‚Äôt believe all happened?), but I‚Äôve been feeling weird the past month and found it hard to focus. These achievements are supposed to ‚Äúprove‚Äù what I‚Äôve been doing hasn‚Äôt been a whole waste of time. They are supposed to be the extrinsic progress markers I‚Äôve always wanted to make my research and art legible to other people.So why do I feel so uncomfortable? Is it that I now feel the burden of extrinsic legibility as something I need to justify working on anything? Do I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve the recognition I‚Äôve gotten? Do I wish more of the projects ‚Äúgot big‚Äù without having to go through the many cycles of failed experiments? (1) maybe a little try as I do to fight it 2) i can‚Äôt deny that the thought comes up every now and then 3) yes).I still get these incredibly nourishing bursts of creativity and momentum, but they fizzle faster than before, and then I find it hard to pull myself to work on the things that I‚Äôve been wanting to do for a long time. I‚Äôm gaining a growing backlog of unfinished projects and as the list grows, it becomes harder to kill off my babies and prioritize which to dedicate my time to. The decision fatigue of choosing each day makes it harder to build the momentum for a new project, and the vicious cycle takes hold.I revisited some old memos where I‚Äôve struggled with being restless and remind myself that I am doing well as long as I‚Äôm‚Äúpracticing a way of being I love‚Äùeach day. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve been doing that lately, but mostly because of this unyielding pressure I feel to produce work and manifest the works that call to me. I don‚Äôt think I really process how long progress takes. I‚Äôm not very good at being patient, nor am I very good at being prudent. I want everything that I dream of, and I don‚Äôt want to compromise. And even though I know how long a life comprises, I feel like there‚Äôs not enough time for all the things that I want to do. I feel antsy with desire and perhaps a bit of a need to prove myself, to show that I am worthy of sticking with what my own heart tells me is important.But maybe I should be feeling this way. It‚Äôs natural that I feel antsy when I‚Äôm trying to focus on so many things. Maybe this is part ofthe workthat I so wish to avoid, part of ‚Äúour struggle to find a way through‚Äù as Yohji Yamamoto recounts. Maybe a month of flailing to reorient my focus is a given. There are no free lunches, and so too does being independent (and working on whatever I want) come with the territory of enduring existential dilemmas and wavering motivations to see my questions through. This is not an easy lifestyle, nor is it something that can be forced all the time. Every day I feel like I‚Äôm answering my life‚Äôs questions. I should feel exhausted, even if all I do in a day is think about that question, even if these questions feel like my life‚Äôs calling. Really, all that matters, is that given the choice, I‚Äôd still choose it again, despite the history and the circumstances and the obstacles, again, despite all the pain and rejection and loneliness that it brings, again, because I remember the moments when it feels like I‚Äôm doing the most important thing I could be doing and ‚Äúwhen the group meshes perfectly.‚Äù And so after my walk around the neighborhood, I sit back down, and I return to the struggle.from My Dear Bomb by Yohji Yamamoto (p.s. if someone has access to the full book as an e-book pls help me get access, I haven‚Äôt been able to find all of the material)Thank you for everyone who is reading this, and welcome to all the new folks (now 522 of you!!).

      <title>[TI-09] the internet is one big video game</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/ti-09-the-internet-is-one-big-video</link>
      <description>I like newsletters that feel more like dispatches than editorialized posts. Inspired byLaurelandRobin, I‚Äôd like to share a little bit about where I am and where I‚Äôve been lately. I write this from Atlas Cafe, a wonderfully cozy cafe near me I like to escape to when my desk starts to feel laden with expectation every once in a while. It‚Äôs been hard lately, to be honest. I wrote last time aboutreaffirming your choices, even and especially when it‚Äôs hard. And I‚Äôve been trying to take my own advice, but I still feel a bit lost, perhaps more so than any moment before in this independent research arc. Still, I find immense joy in the most unexpected places and the people who always support me. The world manages to find a way to strike you with the most indescribable beauty when you need it most.There‚Äôs been a rising trend in the software world to imagine that the future of software is video games. For example,Not Boring Softwareis a company that recreates the standard phone apps from a game-first perspective: 3D designs, meticulous attention to interaction detail, and paired soundtracks. New real-time syncing libraries likePartykit(and my inspired creationplayhtml) are making it incredibly easy to make websites multiplayer, which many games incorporate as the default. This prediction is wise in a lot of ways in terms of interaction, narrative, tutorial, and multiplayer design, and more and more people desire a liveness and tactility in websites that we take for granted in video games.However, today I want to turn the prediction on its head to make another hypothesis:Websites are the future of video games.They are the ‚Äúend game‚Äù of video games. They are spaces where the end players (the website visitors) have the agency to freely interact with others, and not towards any predetermined object, but purely for themselves, discovering who they are in each new environment and finding new ways of relating to one another.The past few weeks I‚Äôve watched several of Tim Rogers‚Äôvideogamereviewson his channelAction Button.To dismiss these reviews as merely ‚Äúvideo game reviews‚Äù would betray the amount of depth, range, and relevance of these cultural artifacts. These ‚Äúcritiques,‚Äù as I‚Äôll refer to them, each focus on a single video game deemed to be ‚Äúseminal‚Äù in some way to the history of video games and run for no less than 5 hours (with the longest coming in at 8+ hours in total). Rogers starts his analysis before the video game, dissecting the existing video game landscape, the studio and designers that created it, and the broader social context, to chart a trail through what kind of impact it has and what it demonstrates as an object of media.two games that Action Button has reviewed (top) screenshot from Doom and (bottom) screenshot from Boku No NatsuyasumiIn his review ofDoom, the famous 1993 demon-slaying game attributed with inventing the ‚Äúfirst-person shooter‚Äù genre and isfamousfor being ported to ridiculous modern devices likesmart fridges,graphing calculators, and even anATM, Rogers recalls a single wistful line from an obscure game magazine review ofDoomaround when it first came out: ‚Äúif only we could have talked to those creatures.‚Äù This line is what Rogers chases throughout the rest of his ‚Äúseason‚Äù of reviews. One of his favorites is areviewofTokimeki Memorial, a Japanese game from 1994 that popularized the ‚Äúdating-sim.‚Äù The game allows you to relive high school as a teenage boy who encounters several girls that he has the option to get to know. Each character has their own personality, and you‚Äôre given several dialogue choices that affect their impression of you. Rather than creatures that are the same every time you see them, Tokimeki Memorial gives the impression where your agency comes into conflict with several others‚Äô, each with their own desires and personalities. At the end of this season, he concludes that more video games should ditch combat mechanics and instead focus on how your choice of actions question and ultimately shape who you are and what you care about.As I watch Tim talk about all this, I think about how websites feel like multiplayer video games, all of which are part of the broader ‚Äúinternet‚Äù universe. One in which the ‚Äúcreatures‚Äù are the cursors of other, real people. And where we can‚Äôt fight each other at all, only talk to one another.fromhttps://twitter.com/spencerc99/status/1675545840319070210Somewhere in the push to make the internet the infrastructure of a global capitalist economy, we lost this perspective on what the internet is. If I asked people to define what websites are to them, they might talk about the capabilities they provide: ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs information at your fingertips,‚Äù ‚ÄúAI that does whatever you ask of it,‚Äù ‚Äúa platform for selling products.‚Äù Or as design artifacts: they provide the basis of interactive, creative pieces of art, media, and writing.But if we distill a website down to its base components, it is a space that allows people to talk to each other. In the era when the internet was new and before we had predetermined what it was ‚Äúfor,‚Äù everyday internet pioneers found ways to talk to one another by making websites for each other. The conversations spanned webs of personal websites, revealing intimate detail in exchange for intimate detail. They bartered histories for kinship, stories for solidarity, identities for community.The websites of our modern-day internet experience reflect quite a different perspective on what websites should be ‚Äúfor.‚Äù Websites are often the expression of a corporate unit, optimized for flow, retention, or the latest trendy design aesthetic. We focus on animation design and gradient layering rather than the interactions that govern how we relate to one another.a living memorial forAlex Nieto, a local killed by SFPD in 2014 with rocks and flowers from neighborsTo embrace ‚Äúwebsites are the future of video games,‚Äù we must turn our focus over to how we can evolve the modern aesthetic of websites. How do we make websites feel more likeembodied objects? What does a website that can become well-worn orpassed downfeel like? How does a website become a living gathering space, one that evolves with the activity of its participants? How can a website enable showing care to each other? How can it facilitatesolidaritybetween people?Rather than solely looking towards video games for inspiration here, we should draw from the decades of activity, community-making, and self-documentation that have been conducted on the internet and question how we can enable new ways for people to relate to one another, drawing on the decades of multiplayer environment design that video games have pioneered.With lightness, Spencersome lingering extra thoughts‚Ä¶I originally discovered this channel through his most recent video, a review of a Japanese game called ‚ÄúBoku No Natsuyasumi‚Äù („Åº„Åè„ÅÆ„Å™„Å§„ÇÑ„Åô„Åø), ‚ÄúMy Summer Vacation‚Äù in English. The game is about a Japanese boy from the big city who goes to their family‚Äôs countryside home for their summer vacation. You play as the boy, Boku (yes the main character‚Äôs name also means ‚ÄúI‚Äù in Japanese), and decide what he does for each day of his vacation, slowly uncovering the hidden wonders of the countryside and the family‚Äôs untold history. No particular ‚Äúobjective‚Äù is given, and the player is given free agency to spend the vacation in the way that most appeals to them. In the end, the player‚Äôs actions lead to several possible scenarios of the player‚Äôs future 25 years later.You should go watch the whole review (although I‚Äôd watch it sped up and split it up into multiple parts like a mini docu-series), but I‚Äôll recount the particularly relevant moments here. The game calls you out for achieving a perfect ‚Äúscore‚Äù in the game. If you try to do everything, optimize for completing every part of the game (whichrequiresthat you have tried and failed before in order to use knowledge gained from the failure for the perfect run on a redo), you are called a liar by the game. The ‚Äúbest‚Äù scenario happens if you only achieve 60-70% of the game. In essence, it rewards you for being true to yourself.The game critiques ‚Äúcompletionist‚Äù mindsets that modern video games encourage. People want to achieve 100% and will optimize their way into the best build you can create. In big video games, expansions have to be continually created that create ever-increasing power creeps in order to keep things interesting. If you can race in the game, then the race will be one to the bottom. To escape this prophecy of expectation, we have to be encouraged to find new ways of measuring time and progress.As video games have shifted towards hyper-optimization, the internet has gone a similar direction. Friction has been systematically eliminated and sophisticated automated experimentation infrastructure enables optimization of key metrics at a microscopic level of detail. In return, we‚Äôve come to view websites and the broader internet more and more as a purely utilitarian medium. Even social media, which at some point was positioned as something for self-expression and community-making has become almost entirely a space for influence climbing.What websites and apps reward us for doing 60% of all the things that they offer? We need more websites that gently guide us to trust our own choices and intuitions, that chide us when we try to do it all and work ourselves to the bone, that nudge us to find beauty in unexpected places, to find the poetry in the lazy.Thank you for everyone who is reading this, and welcome to all the new folks (now 530 of you!!). If you‚Äôd like to support my independent work, I‚Äôd appreciate if you shared anything I‚Äôve made that resonates with someone who you think would enjoy it (and I also have asponsors pagefor people to support my independent work and get inside scoops)!</description>

      <title>field notes on being a creative [pt. 1]</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/field-notes-on-being-a-creative-pt</link>
      <description>I write to you lost somewhere amongst the clouds in a window seat (my favorite kind in front of the wing so there‚Äôs an unobstructed view outside). It‚Äôs late, and the dark mass below shifts between pockets of sprawling lights and a gaping darkness. I‚Äôm headed home to spend time with my family. Are you starting to look forward to the holiday season? I hope you find and cherish some time with your family and loved ones soon. Last week, I had the opportunity to work with my friend Kristoffer on asyllabus for walking the internet. I hope it takes you to an unexpectedly wonderful place. Today, I will talk about my relationship with creativity, the first part in a series.Growing up and all through college, I don‚Äôt believe anyone would have described me ascreative. Instead, the words that would have come to the minds of teachers and peers probably would have included rational, disciplined, polite, reliable, organized, serious. All qualities that are certifiablynotwhat you might associate with those who think of creative work as their life craft, otherwise known as ‚Äúartists.‚ÄùI think this started changing drastically when I first began to dance. After some number of classes, I crossed a threshold where I felt the natural urge to move my body when listening to music I loved. I suddenly had anintuitionfor movement, and I had atastefor the kind of movement that felt right. With this change, I suddenly felt much more space wherever I moved through the world‚ÄîI could play, allow my intuition to emerge and trust it to be right, rather than discarding anything that didn‚Äôt conform to the worldview that had been pressed on me.Now, I treat the world as my playground for creation. Shadows form natural frames that make even the most ordinary object seem like a priceless object. Leftovers are a treasure trove for a new favorite dish. Fallen leaves and wilting flowers on the sidewalk become the found material for a beautiful bouquet for a loved one. Everything you see around you can become material for your creative energy.In aTikTok day-in-the-life of an artist, we follow them on a tour through their house. Immediately you find that so much of what they do has become suffused with personalized practices that shift reality in a certain way.‚Äúhe puts himself into any little thing he does‚Äù ‚ÄúI kind of like express how I feel about the day through my outfit, so it‚Äôs like making a little piece of art each morning.‚ÄùIn the comments section, you find how much these little acts of creativity resonate‚Äîthey evoke a whimsical wonder that is hard to turn away from.‚Äú@Luther üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è: im sobbing rn, knowing there are ppl like this sprinkled around the world, who can create wonder in small things‚Ä¶ it makes life worth living‚Äù @IsLocal: take the mundane in the world and warp it with your own creativity sourceI believe that everyone has this innate creativity inside of them, and if we don‚Äôt feel it, then we‚Äôre just missing the right environment for it to emerge. That means if you don‚Äôt feel creative and want to be, you can become creative by shaping your environment.Mary Ruefle says that the best piece of advice she ever received was from her art class teacher:‚Ä¶ ‚Äúby bringing her hand a little ways in one direction, she left a mark upon the paper. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all there is to it,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs a miracle. Once there was nothing, and now there‚Äôs a mark.""from Madness, Rack, and HoneyWe do not have to earn the right to make a mark. We do not have to drive ourselves into the ground to make a difference. We do not have to win a big prize, or become a millionaire, or be a genius to change the world.All we have to do is listen to what our hearts whisper and repeat those words into the world so that one other person may hear it and remark to themselves, ‚Äúah, now that‚Äôs something.‚ÄùMarina Abramoviƒá is a performance artist who gained fame through conducting very mundane (along with absurd and seemingly impossible) tasks under conditions that are physically impossible. Abramoviƒá‚Äôs creative practice came from re-imagining what the everyday could be, and then training her most personal everyday object (her body) into her canvas for shaping the world.Her memoir reveals some of her earliest recollections describing what she pays attention to, and how she decided to play with the fabric of reality to imagine different possibilities:I never played with dolls. I never wanted dolls. And I didn‚Äôt like toys. I preferred to play with the shadows of passing cars on the wall or a ray of sun streaming through the window. The light would catch the dust particles as they traveled to the floor, and I would imagine that this dust contained little planets with different galactic peoples, aliens who came to visit us, traveling on the rays of the sun. And then there were the glowing beings in the plakar. My entire childhood was full of spirits and invisible beings. It was shadows, and dead people that I could see.Later, Abramoviƒá describes what she made for her first exhibition showing at a student center in Belgrade:I brought in a peanut in its shell and fixed it to the wall with a straight pin. The peanut stuck out just far enough from the wall to cast a tiny shadow. I called the piece Cloud With Its Shadow. As soon as I saw that little shadow, I realized two-dimensional art truly was a thing of the past for me‚Äîthat piece opened a whole different dimension. And that show opened new worlds for many people.‚ÄùBeing creative is a matter of discovering alternative realities adjacent to the dominant one people are perceiving and creating a space that empowers others to enter these realities. InCloud With Its Shadow, Abramoviƒá introduces a simple twist of our expectations to help us see the world in a little more whimsical way, that helps us see the world as she does its shadows.I saw another similar piece a few weeks ago that has stayed with me since. Something so simple that changed the way I look at letters and fonts.Half a Dozen Eggs, Quarter of a Dozen Raisins by Lenka ClaytonDiscovering different realities relies on being able to see them in the first place, and tune how you see the world, which is why I love artists who focus on pieces that train people tosee.Robert Irwin says ‚Äúthe ordinary if we could but see it, is extraordinary.‚Äù In his works, he constantly attempts to create a dialogue with viewers, challenging them to see what he sees, and rewarding them for figuring out the slant. For example, one of his most large-scale works, Getty Museum‚Äôs Central Garden, features seasonal plantings that highlight the foundational architecture in new and varying ways1.an overhead view of Central GardenGeorgia O‚ÄôKeefe says ‚ÄúTo see takes time.‚Äù And in her career, she returned to the same subjects over and over in new mediums, during new seasons, and at different points of her life, finding new details and entire worlds emerge in the same subjects.Train at Night in the Desertby Georgia O‚ÄôKeefeI‚Äôm sure Irwin would have agreed with her, given he spent two years painting lines and staring at them for over ten hours daily, continuously attempting to ‚Äúsee‚Äù the true form of a line.Every time I wander out into the world, I treat it as an opportunity to make an exchange‚Äîputting a piece of myself into the world and accepting a piece of the world into myself. You cansee creatively, viewing the world for the beauty within each thing in it, rather than what it should be or what use it has.J has a lovely practice of gathering bags in bags: a sling bag inside a tote inside a backpack, a matryoshka of pouches, each with its own frames for seeing.One of my persistent rituals is looking in the night sky for the moon whenever I‚Äôm outside. I‚Äôm learning the different shapes she takes, her patterns for rising, and how her light casts shadows.I love mediums that create a constrained site to invite people to contribute their own personality. Cairns on the beach, sidewalk community libraries, a communal wall in the neighborhood cafe. In digital space,every comments sectionpresents an opportunity to put a piece of yourself into the networked aether.Being a creative means embracing the urge to put more of yourself‚Äîyour identity, personality, and unique way of seeing‚Äîinto the world, whether it be the way you make your breakfast in the morning or your trick for getting through your morning commute, or the themes that keep coming up among the thousands of photos in your camera roll. When we conform, we push that part of ourselves away, deeper into the recesses of our bodies.Train yourself to listen to your voice, your sight, your taste. Feel for its most subtle grooves and accents. Know it like you know your own face.Next time I write to you about this topic, it‚Äôll be on how you collect based on this taste and instinct.reader exerciseWhen was the last time you heard this voice? What did it tell you to do? Did you listen?Make a log (a physical journal or for the digital-native gatherers an Apple Note) to collect all the moments you feel this feeling and noting what it asks of you.You don‚Äôt always have to follow through, but try to do it at least once a week (adjust according to your comfort level).Practice putting more of yourself into the world. Practice answering yourself when you askwho you are.Remember how it feels to be fully, unabashedly yourself. Remember how it feels when you put that kernel of yourself into the world.1Robert Irwin passed away a few weeks ago, and thetributeshighlighted his journey to changing our perception of the world.</description>

      <title>spines for a lifetime</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/spines-for-a-lifetime</link>
      <description>I haven't written anything for a while. Even my daily journal from the past month looks awfully empty. My hands feel rusty going flicking across the keyboard. I have feelings I want to express, but I can't seem to get them across the page right.I'm listening to Ryuichi Sakomoto'sSolitude, and I can feel my heart beating with the solemn crescendos. The night feels darker this time of year. I watch the orange glow of a paper lamp cascade off the whitewashed walls. Cars pass regularly, creating a symphony with the soaked streets. I wonder how long it'll take me for the words to come out as I wish they would.Dan Flavin at the Menil Collection in HoustonMy pen has been silent, in large part, because I've felt uncertain. You might have noticed the theme over the past few months: a pernicious, creeping doubt of my choices and commitments. In response, I reminded myself of mywill to continue choosingand tofocus on what I want. Still, it slithers back when I look away.The thing that has helped most recently is thinking about what it means to cultivate a lifelong practice.I'm prone to focus on short-term objectives. I want to release something so I can get the endorphin rush of getting something done. I like jumping from project to project, testing the limits of the range of work I can produce in a condensed period. Sometimes, when my momentum is strong, this is an overwhelming source of power. Other times, when I'm in the gap between projects, I feel like nothing will compare to the energy I once had. I think a better medium exists, one where I can immerse myself into the surge of momentum when it arrives, and when absent, I can put all of myself into the hearty work of living.M told me about the idea of buildingspinesthe other week. The idea is to focus on building a foundation that will allow what you want to naturally emerge, rather than focusing on individual achievements. It's playing themeta game. I'm reminded ofCharles' philosophy of slownessin building Are.na, with the hopes of becoming the next Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan, one of the oldest businesses in the world. When you're building for a horizon on the scale of decades, individual failures or day-to-day setbacks don't matter so much as moving towards what you're drawn to and what calls to you in return. There's also a lot less pressure on finishing things at some artificial pace. Rather than filling out a list of accolades, what's asked for is creating the right conditions that last.winter shadows in the morningYesterday, I readMy Trade is Mysteryover the course of the day. JZ recommended it to me as something similar toMadness, Rack, and Honey, and Carl Phillips' words felt like the exact echoes I needed to hear. Phillips shares what kind of life allows for poetry to emerge and the kinds of obstacles you will necessarily need to overcome. While ostensibly about poetry, his main "trade," his words resonated with all my creative practices, both writing-related and not.At the end of the first chapter on "ambition," the kind that is "for the work," "a steady drive, without expectation," Phillips writes, "[A]s much as possible, let the work be everything; for the work will save you."You might think that Phillips is a workaholic, but he thinks of work in a different way. His work is his art, his lifelong trade, the thing that defines his purpose.Work, in this case, is his way of living. This form is completely different from thecorporate workwe're accustomed to and even from the active labor of a craft (for example, writing). The work, for Phillips, is to live life attentively and write when life compels you to."Meanwhile, given that everything we write comes to us via the many lenses of the experiences we've accumulated across a life-we speak of trees, for example, according to what we know of trees by actual experience and through what we've experienced of trees in books, movies, nursery rhymes, and more-then everything we do is at some level research for the next poem.""Everything we do is at some level research for the next [thing]." When theworkis something that we are compelled to with every fiber of our being, then we are alwaysworking. Even our waiting times fuel the research that gives us our next breakthrough. Art, or any kind of craft, is not the perfect result of years and years of polishing; rather, it is the "result of my having allowed myself to stray from any marked path and to become lost. The poem is the evidence‚Äîlike tracks, or footprints‚Äîof my quest into and across strange territory, the shape I've left almost as if unintentionally behind me."This kind of work cannot be rushed. It cannot be forced out by pumping in more hours. It's a slow task, a deliberate one. Movements without waste, consistently done are best. But how do you balance the urgency that arises without warning? Perhaps a distinction is needed between the kind that yearns for external validation‚Äîpress mentions, likes and retweets, a warm email reply‚Äîand the one that demands energy for transformation. The former is nice, and sometimes even necessary, to press forward but is ultimately a distraction from the work. The latter is the invitation that only comes when you least expect it‚Äîthe opportunity that we must always be prepared to dedicate ourselves to.a mural in progress on the corner of my block in SF. It's been lovely to watch it slowly evolve and take shape week over week, witnessing the foundation transform into San Francisco's skyline.Instead of jumping my focus from artifact to artifact as I'm used to doing, I want to build a tall, steady spine to support my varying creative outlets. I need to form a foundation for sustainable, consistent, and fulfilling creation, an environment strong enough to last for a lifetime.I can no longer hide behind the premise that this period of my life is temporary‚Äîa diversion from the main "career." I must make my life,this life, the thing I bet everything on. I'll work carefully, but decisively. I'll sculpt a home for my work, my art, my soul.Meanwhile, I'll define projects that I can consistently tend to1, the kind that can be myworry stones, ones that will stay for decades to come. And perhaps, when I look back years from now, I'll reminisce fondly from a hearth I made with my own two hands.Thank you to everyone who is reading this, and welcome to all the new folks (now567of you!!).

      <title>[TI-10] make small web tools</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/ti-10-make-small-web-tools</link>
      <description>One of my favorite activities on the internet these days is finding tiny web tools and libraries that just do one niche thing really well (or at least, decently well and the site‚Äôs personality makes up for it).From generatingASCII artto findingWikipedia articles about placesnear your location, to changing the faces ofimages to look at your cursor, the web is full of wondrous gadgets (perusemy full catalog). I keep these tabs pinned in a browser window and think of them as myinternet toolshed. I head to theriverwhen I‚Äôm in a visual mood. I scroll throughhttps://transparenttextures.com/when I‚Äôm in need of an interesting feel. I go tocareful wordsto play with language when it‚Äôs not coming out the right way, and I go to mylocal clipboard converterwhenever I need to paste some content into Obsidian to get it formatted correctly. I even havea placeI visit to create ·µó·∂¶‚Åø ∏ ·µó·µâÀ£·µó (you‚Äôd be surprised how often one needs tiny text!).I like how distinct these tools feel, each with their own stories, personalities, and creators. They feel a lot likemy homecooked appsexcept they‚Äôve been made and made available by someone else for me to use. This means I don't have the agency to change them (except for open-source ones), but they still feel personal and are often designed well enough for the specific use I have in mind. I‚Äôve grown fond of them over the months as we make memories in the timeless sea that is the web. My hands are accustomed to their interfaces‚ÄîI skip over the introduction text as soon as I arrive and the clang and clack of industry begins.As much as I like the idea of a single general-purpose tool for creating any software that you want (I passionately worked atCoda, after all), I don‚Äôt think we can make something entirely new that lasts forever. More and more, we want to build something that isthesolution1to everything, the tool to end all tools, rather than making something useful in one specific way.While I applaud the effort, I find myself drawn to the simple beauty of single-purpose tools more and more lately. They don‚Äôt claim to be anything they are not. They do the one thing well, and that‚Äôs all they have to do.Being optimized for a specific task, single-purpose tools necessarily have constraints. As a result, they tend to look and function pretty uniquely, which often makes them hard to miss. Some are made fun of for how niche their purpose is (like the avocado slicer) and others are celebrated for their dedication to a single craft (like theultimate Bonsai scissors).theOXO Avocado Slicerand atamagoyaki egg panAnd although they‚Äôre only advertised as having a single purpose, sometimes their constraints actually provide a fertile environment to find new creative uses, like usinga vanity mirror to look at flowers. Purists may be shocked at the idea of using something so meticulously crafted as Bonsai scissors to snip green onions, but I like that we challenge the purported single-nature of these tools. We don‚Äôt make it easy for them.On the web, there‚Äôs something charming about the ‚Äúsmallness‚Äù of these tools, in contrast to the big polished monoliths that claim to do everything. I often trust a site that is a little unresponsive, but obviously made by a person much more than a polished site with a landing page that looks like Stripe‚Äôs (or whatever the latest trending aesthetic will be). When the site feels like its made by a person, it feels different from what we‚Äôre accustomed to seeing on the web nowadays. These sites are not SEO-optimized. They feature plain, sometimes grammatically incorrect and sometimes dry and lengthy, language. They may not be mobile-responsive and may even occasionally be down when you try to visit them.They aren‚Äôt trying toconvinceyou to use the tool because they likely made the tool for themselves, first and foremost. And if they do, it's purely because they want more people to be able to use it, rather than getting signups for their product2.(from left to right) Josh Comeau‚Äôsgradient generator, thepractice guide maker,andtheitalic text generator,These kinds of tools mesh well with the rising culture of getting creative value out of the things you already have. We glamorize the creative resilience of creating a feast out of kitchen scraps and leftovers to sustain ourselves (girl dinner). And, we love finding newlife hacksto avoid buying more things. Another part I love about these tools is that their creator took the time to turn the code they likely originally wrote themselves into a website that makes the tool available for others to benefit from. They are connecting their creation to the broader internet, and as a result, giving me another tool to put in my toolshed3.Sure, more people now make these tools to capture a popular search query with fancy domains, SEO-optimized pages, and a web of upsells and ads waiting in the wings. But for every one of those, I believe we‚Äôll still find people like you and me who make small tools because they need them and share them because they think it‚Äôll help at least one other person on this wide, wide internet.When you try to make something that solves everything, you obsess over questions of power: how to make something that is all-powerful and everlasting. But when you make a small tool that solves one thing, you only need to answer a very personal one:does it solve my problem?Rather than the question of how to make software that lasts forever, I think more abouthow longandwho forand where will it push the space to develop. I want to see more visionary efforts that embrace the pluralistic nature of the internet, that allow you to bring many little tools together in one place, while preserving their unique characteristics.Making some small tools for the web isn't a bad place to start.What are some of your favorite small tools and libraries you‚Äôve come across on the web? When do you wish you could combine them together? Do you already cobble some of them together regularly?in related news, Tiff Ng wrote a lovely piece about the whimsy of the internet forMIT Technology Review, featuring html garden! Speaking of, the garden‚Äôs exhibition at the DeYoung ended this past weekend, and I got a new shiny domain for it (htmls.garden, sadlyhtml.gardenwas taken).And here‚Äôs a sneak peek of that app I‚Äôve been working on (my first mobile app ever!). If you‚Äôre interested in curating multi-media albums on-the-go from your phone and/or useare.naliberally, just reply and let me know (iPhone only for now).the logo on my homescreenThank you for everyone who is reading this, and welcome to all the new folks (now581of you!!). If you‚Äôd like to support my independent work, I‚Äôd appreciate if you shared anything I‚Äôve made that resonates with someone who you think would enjoy it (and I also have asponsors pagefor people to support my independent work and get inside scoops)!1Perhaps aspiring to be the modern ‚ÄùMother of All Demos‚Äù that becomes a productionized reality2One of my favorite things to notice in a small web tool is when they go to the extra effort to make it accessible to people irrespective of programming ability. I still think about thetransforming text librarythat Jacky made where I helped make it compatible with plain-text format (anda live playgroundfor use). This lead to students from a local college using it in their final projects even though they weren't coders! That has got to be one of the best feelings of making a small tool.3I have this long-standing project idea note about creating an "internet sack" browser extension to carry around these tools that you find on the internet around with you. Perhaps these websites just appear as iframes that you can pull up as pop-ups when you need them. Maybe they could even specify "widget" displays for a compact version that you could embed. Maybe you could even pass them data directly from the page just by highlighting things or dragging them over. Let me know if this is interesting to you, and I might find some time to build it?</description>

      <title>[TI-11] dedications, gifts, odes</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/ti-11-dedications-gifts-odes</link>
      <description>I'm sitting under the warm glow of circular paper lamps that fill the ceiling. I'm at a local bakery with a vast open seating area. Because I work from home 90% of the time now, I forget how much I enjoy working with the clamor of people living (talking, eating, bustling) around me. Somehow, the noise fuels my focus, while silence can feel like too much pressure. I like the camouflage that working amidst a big crowd offers. I feel safe when I'm surrounded by the clatter of living.I've been thinking about gifting. I have an unfinished gift guide for 2023 I started during the holiday season that I suppose is too late to send out now (but will maybe make a good spring surprise?). Likely, it was inspired by me making more gifts lately. Ceramics, as a craft, makes for a convenient medium for gift-making. You can imagine something and form a rough prototype of it relatively easily. S and I made a bunch of fortune cookies out of ceramic, and I've been giving some of them away with handwritten fortunes stuffed inside.the array of glazes and fortunesEach cookie has a different glaze and I chose their recipient to match. Combine that with the fact that each fortune is customized, and the gifts feel like 1/1 creations, made for their recipient.Laurel writes that she "only makes odes," celebrations of the worth of another person or influence. I like this framing because it provides a powerful perspective of "who am I honoring?" which makes a powerful contrast to the growth-minded perspectives that have started to take over discussions of what you should focus your time on. Rather than a chart going up and to the right being the marker of success, making odes is done well when it helps people feel a new-found appreciation for your target subject.Every couple months, discourse comes up on what you should prioritize when youwork on a side project. The pendulum usually swings along a spectrum of fun-maxxing vs. utility-maxxing (clout, revenue, etc.). But another option exists. You can make something to bring it into existence for someone else. Rilke says that the best art comes out of necessity. Making something for the purpose of someone else may not benecessityexactly, but it's something close to it. When you make something for someone that they deeply appreciate, the exchange captures a similar kind of urgent resonancePersonal gifts are much likesingle-purpose websites and tools. They are designed for a single purpose, too‚Äîto make a specific someone feel appreciated. They have the flexibility to be uniquely beautiful because they are catering to the tastes of a single person. There is no conflict of interest. You can match their taste as closely as your ability allows you to.When you make something for one person, you can narrow in on emotional resonance. Novels and movies convey a universal message by telling a compelling personal story. "The personal is the universal" as Carl Rogers' famous saying goes. To be general, we must be specific. To reach the universe, we must touch one person deeply.Many general-purpose tools and projects have emerged from gifts. I'm reminded of how thisexpanding text libraryemerged fromJackymaking a website as ananniversary giftfor his partner and how thismusicBottlesproject from the MIT Media Lab emerged from creating agift to a mother. Rainer Maria Rilke'sLetters to a Young Poet, an influential book for artists for many years, is a series of letters between Rilke and a student seeking his advice. Even when the specific someone you are honoring is yourself, it can translate into something that connects others.The Making of Prince of Persiais a cleaned-up collection of Jordan Mechner's mostly raw journal entries from the period he worked on the video game.All of us are so unique in undeniable ways, yet we're also not as different as we think. Perhaps working to honor someone or something can bring us closer to the universal answers humankind has always sought.A few months ago, I found a dead bird in my apartment's shared backyard. The night before a bird had flown into my room through an open window and got stuck inside for a while. An image of it perched atop our curtain rod lingers in my mind. I think I must have taken this as a sign that I had a duty to this passed bird. Even as my mind raced with questions like "won't it look weird for me to be carrying around a dead animal?" and "what will people think of me digging a hole in a public park?", My body seemed to move on its own to honor this bird.I put on some gloves, wrapped its body in a plastic bag, and took it to a favorite park nearby. I found a clearing in front of a bush of purple flowers to give it a proper burial. After covering the hole and gingerly laying its body inside. I assembled an altar out of found tributes from the park: flowers, a fallen strawberry fruit, and a broken fragment of green stone.left to right, bird stuck in room photo taken by S and the initial altarThis all happened several months ago, but I still pass by the spot regularly to check up on the shrine. The tributes are mostly gone each time, and I try to replace them with something each time to mark my coming. In an act offolk programmingand platform reappropriation, I added the location of the shrine toGoogle Maps, so that others might contribute offerings when they pass by.I find myself paying more attention to birds since this act. I notice them in the crevices of trees and atop distant phone lines, where I wouldn't have seen them before. My head swerves to scan the surroundings when I hear a call that I don't recognize. I look at community-made shrines and notice the traces of offerings through the weeks.This act of dedication has changed me in ways I didn't imagine, and I'm sure it'll continue to do so.What dedications have you made? Do you know of other stories where a broader project emerged from a gift or dedication?Thank you for everyone who is reading this and to the 587 inboxes subscribed. To support my independent work, please share my work with someone you think would enjoy it.Thank you to the 11 people whosupport mewith a monthly sponsorship: Luis, James, Jacky, Jonah, Rachel, Raymond, Dan, Crystal, Max, Gleb, and Eric.</description>

I may be more likely to trust a site that is a little unresponsive, or that features grammatically incorrect language that‚Äôs dry and lengthy, or that wasn‚Äôt designed to be used on mobile, or that occasionally breaks entirely, because all of these things are perfectly human.Its maker isn‚Äôt trying toconvinceyou to use the tool because they likely made it to solve a problem for themselves, first and foremost.gradient generator,practice guide maker,anditalic text generator,Tiny tools mesh well with the rising culture of getting creative value out of the things you already have. We glamorize the creative resilience of making a feast out of kitchen scraps and leftovers to sustain ourselves (‚Äúgirl dinner‚Äù). And, we love finding newlife hacksto avoid buying more things.When you try to make something that solves everything, you obsess over questions of power: how to make something that is omnipotent and everlasting. But when you make something that does one thing well, the questions are much more personal:does it solve my problem?andfor how long?andwho for?andwhere will it push the space around it?I want to see more efforts that embrace the pluralistic nature of the internet, that allow tiny tools to converse with each other in a proverbial toolbox, while preserving their unique personalities.Starting small isn't a bad place to start.What are some of your favorite small tools and libraries you‚Äôve come across on the web? When do you wish you could combine them together? Do you already cobble some of them together regularly?

      <title>touching computers</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/touching-computers</link>
      <description>Last fall while taking a hand-building ceramics class1with S, I had the wild idea that I wanted to make something to carry my website around with me. I was thinking about the logo for both my website and this newsletter, which comes from my Chinese name, Ê≠£. I wanted a physical, tangible representation of my identity, something that could explain more than words what I care about to people when I first meet them.What if I made a trinket that held my website so I could carry around a thing that feels like one of the most true expressions of myself?Simultaneously, I'd been playing with NFC chips2more lately, and it felt like a perfect combination of mediums to achieve my vision. NFC chips can hold small amounts of data, including links that open when tapped by compatible devices. The idea was to make a ceramic trinket with my logo embossed on the front and somehow get an NFC chip on the inside.After a few iterations, involving MATH(!!) to calculate clay shrinkages to size the container to the NFC chip and testing whether NFC chips survive sitting through a kiln (spoiler alert they do not), I finally made a version that feels pretty good and works really well! I fired it in two pieces, one acting as the "base" and one as the "lid" to insert the NFC chip after they came out of the kiln, sealed up the hole with epoxy putty, andSIGIL Iwas complete.overhead view of the stamp in actionReflecting on a few months of carryingSIGIL Iwith me, I'm really enjoying being able to carry around a tangible object that somehow represents me on a deeper level? The physical objectfeels niceand I enjoy its varied texture from the logo marks, an uneven layer of clay, and chipped glaze. It feels rough and incomplete yet deeply important, like my website. Whenever I get to show it to others (often when they want to learn more about my work, which leads me to ask "can I give you my website?"), there's this look of genuine wonder and delight from the whole experience. I especially love how this feels in more "professional" settings. The playful joy that emerges from the interaction feels like a tiny subversion against all the 3D chess politics that are usually involved in networking situations.This focus on physical augmentation has a long history intangible computingfrom theMIT Media Lab. Their principles focus on direct manipulation and seamless integration between the digital and physical worlds. For example, a core exploration is around "ambient displays" that leverage physical space as an environment for digital material to be felt, such as a "wind of bits" causing pinwheels to spin.from theslidesof Hiroshi Ishii, the head of the Tangible Media GroupIt's an interesting time to revisit these principles with the latest buzz in computing around the Vision Pro.I still haven't gotten the chance to try it out3), but on first instinct, I feel less excited aboutaugmented reality (AR)that involves overlaying software on the physical world for a solo experience, of which the Vision Pro seems to represent the apex achievement. This approach seems to only grow our attachment to the device rather than any of the reality being augmented. It hijacks physical reality and massages it into the optimal form for our digital realities.Instead, I'm compelled by the kind that involves imbuing software into physical objects that are perceptible by everyone, in the same way physical objects already are. I want to imbue physical objects with computational properties. I want computing that brings people together where they already are, rather than more advanced and convenient ways of immersing into digital realities.This is partially what makes my stamp feel so magical. It's meaninglesswithout other peopleand the computational property activates a communal sense of joy and wonder. This shared sense of reality is a core part of the tangible computing explorations.Compared to augmented reality, tangible computing is:an inherentlyshared experiencebecause it involves enchanting physical objects that everyone can see rather than individual technological overlaysadds functionality inherently tailored to a specific object'sphysical propertiesI'm very excited about all the developments that continue to come out in this field from folks likefolkand the innovations paintingcircuits. I imagine a day in the future when we can simply draw our computers and manipulate them from both our devices and the objects we already have in our lives.On my end, I'm excited to continue exploring this idea by creating NFC-enhanced objects. The next step in my explorations is to lean more into the "manipulable" property of the tangible computing principles. NFC doesn't allow for a ton of expressiveness. The communication is one-way. But what if we could communicate two-way, and visitors could shape not only the digital space the object holds but also the very object itself? One novel emphasis in my explorations, compared to prior work, is an emphasis on no or minimal battery power required.The requirement of a constant power supply limits where these devices can be placed. But I want tangible computing devices that can be as commonplace and ubiquitous as the flyers that plaster telephone poles across cities.I think embedding these tangible computing devices in public can help facilitate and strengthen local communities.We already feel a latent connection to those in our communities even if we don't know them: the other regulars at our favorite cafe, those who love the same park bench that we always visit on our walks, our neighbors who we pass on the street day after day. That bond activates with a surprising strength when we learn something intimate about them. I think about how I feel seeing other people's works at the pottery studio, the fortunes people write atBuddhist temples, or the little messages people leave in the sidewalk.a warm message on a San Francisco sidewalkI think these public computing devices can become a kind of infrastructure to facilitate this. In the same way that we already share with our community through memorials, neighborhood libraries, and community fridges, I wonder what computing as a material can offer us if we could embed them in public areas as easily. Can we move beyond merely facilitating connection tobuilding solidarity?I want to makecomputing shrines4: communally created and maintained sites of intimacy and solidarity facilitated by the fabric of computing.I want computers that I can touch and make me feel touched, by all the lives that I'm surrounded by.recent updates &amp; asksplayhtml react launch: I made a big update toplayhtmlto add react support. It feels oddly good to use to make small communal web experiences, like having a"choose-the-color" websiteand acursor party.

      <title>computing you can hold</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/computing-you-can-hold</link>
      <description>assorted hands from mywebstone workshopsA person's hand can tell youso much about them. Perhaps it's only natural because they are our instruments for creation.Maybe that's why there's something so intimate about designing a computing experience that unfolds in someone's hand. Designing a mobile app and handheld devices should, therefore, be an act of love.Unfortunately, it doesn't feel that way for many, if not most, of our everyday mobile experiences. Most apps feel like they've been designed to check off requirements and not for people to use. Some even feel like they actively work against what you want, to hold you against your will. Others simply feel like they want your money (or your data to sell for money).Our devices are trapped in platforms that allow for little experimentation, with companies spending millions lobbying againstmodifying or repairing devicesandopen payments.Between making amobile appandwebstones(and the experiences that these stones should lead you to), handheld computer experiences have been a bit of an obsession recently.Hosting these workshops has shown me all the different ways we hold our phones and conceptualize how they talk to other things. We each have a personal relationship with our devices, from the unique way we hold them to how we choose the wallpaper and font to the way we arrange our apps.And in a world where we're always expecting more from our phones, watching people make somethingfortheir phones is a strangeand humanizingexperience. In these workshops, these phones feel like their own individuals. One participant in the webstones workshop created a notch in the stone to cradle their phone‚Äôs corner, and L created a pillow for their phone to go to sleep (do not disturb mode).There's a tenderness to introducing clay in this way, activating our hands as the creative tools they are and in a way that "gives back" to the devices that do so much for us. These creations feel intimate in the way that a handheld computing experience should. They introduce a new possibility, a new branch to unfold in our relationship with our devices.It feels impossible to imagine this kind of relationship with our devices when our narrative with mobile technology is fraught with tales of exploitation, from endless hours of scrolling to apps that won't let you do the thing you want and need to do1.But when these mobile experiences go well, there is so much potential for magic. I see it in the sparks of joy and wonder when people tap their phones to my webstone and see the prompt for my website pop up on their screens. I've seen it in the yelps of wonder and the excited chatter when people start imagining their own webstone possibilities at these workshops.I'm excited for a future of handheld computing that feels like this, shaped by people's hopes, filled with play, and open to possibilities.I talk about the relationship between our hands and our devices because I'm interested in the texture of computing. And by that I mean, what does itfeellike to interact with a computer, with our mobile devices? What emotions are prickled and what kinds of memories arise? How does the digital environment hold your hopes and make space to achieve your desires?Does it feel funto use? Does it make your body resonate like it does when you see a star shoot across the sky, when you hear the crash of waves standing at the edge of a beach, when you feel the warmth of the day fall to cool night as the last rays of sun set over the horizon?A handheld digital experience should be as intimate as it feels to hold someone's hand. You must support the phone's full weight with your body, and it must support the full weight of your generous attention. It's not a one-way extraction, but rather an exchange‚Äîa kind of barter. In return for your labor, it must deliver something, an experience, a tool, a place‚Äîone worthy of your concentrated gaze.This is the bargain that must be upheld each time we interact with the computers in our hands. This is the contract we must remember in our everyday digital experiences. This is the deal we made.an alien-like plaster mold of my hand holding a phoneSo when does a mobile experience uphold its end of the bargain?It feels fast. It feels sturdy and trustworthy.It feels expressive and personal. It feels warm, reassuring, and accepting, like an old friend, the kind you can pick up a conversation with even after several years apart.It should feel playfully magical. It should feel inviting andfull of possibility, like a dance circle that calls you in.It makes it feel like it's okay to be yourself. It should feel like a collaboration, a communion, like the moment you touch hands with someone you love for the first time‚Äîthe moment you feel their heartbeat meld with yours.When have you felt this way with a mobile experience? What else should they feel like?

      <title>opening yourself to support</title>
      <link>https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/opening-yourself-to-support</link>
      <description>my laptop bundled in my sweater to protect against the sun during the eventAt theAre.na spring cleaningI hosted, we discovered that we all shared one thing in common: none of us had a full-time job. Instead, P &amp; T compared themselves to "professional sidemissioners," people who always have a project but never have a job.Most people are on a side quest these days (or yearning for the freedom to pursue them), whether that "side quest" is their life's work or simply some time to rest from the daily grind of a 9-5. With the continuingloss of trustin any sort of institution to provide a stable existence, much less a nurturing one, lots of us are in some form of employment instability or looking for an exit. Everyone wants to be free.When I started my "professional" sidequest last year, I phrased it asa chapter of independence. I was breaking free from my corporate bonds and making space for my creative desires. People I met commended my bravery to be nontraditional and commit to myself.There's a romanticism in the "myth of the lone genius" that lives on in the modern age filled with independent creatives and solo makers. "Doing your own thing" and going indie signal an unshakeable confidence in your abilities. People dream of toiling away on a game for years on end likeConcernedApe, the maker of Stardew Valley, and becoming an overnight success."All it took was nearly life-ruining levels of obsessiveness"(from theabove profileof Eric Barone AKA ConcernedApe)But there are real (and honestly, necessary) "marketing" benefits that come with this branding. How else can indie, mostlysolo devscompete with triple-A game studios and venture-backed startups?How do we set expectations, and ask for help, without leaving out all the people who have made our work possible?Even when you do want to make space for all the people and communities that have enabled your accomplishments, many systems don't provide space to acknowledge them publicly. We can send them thanks in private and makepersonal dedicationsto them, but how do we make them part of the work as much as we are?As the year progressed, I became more intimately aware of how much I did was inextricably tied to and made possible by someone else. Even as I spent hours on end nurturing ideas and cultivating them into public projects, they would've been meaningless without the community who gave me early feedback and decided to bet on (and believe in) me.It's not much of an exaggeration to say I owe so much of my current art practice to Max and Shelby of theHTML Reviewtaking a chance on me &amp; giving space to showhtml garden. This work led to my first encounter with the physical installation of internet art and formed a foundation for finding my unique artistic voice.Kristoffer'shighlighting ofmy workhas connected me with several supporters and collaborators. My partner and close friends have given me so much detailed feedback that helps what I do connect meaningfully with people.This story repeats over and over for so much of the work I've been able to do throughout the past year. Friends giving me feedback, collaborating with me, and supporting my work with not only an unshakeable belief in the importance of it, but also materially connecting me to the right opportunities and people to make it possible to continue.And most of it has started from the courage to ask for help and the dedication to honoring and returning the gift.fromhttps://twitter.com/spencerc99/status/1790630845109399858Last week, I releasedGather, an offline-enabled multimedia collections app that connects to Are.na. It's the first time I've explicitly asked for monetary support for something I've made, and I was terrified to do so. It's not required, simply a nudge of the labor that went into the app's creation and the maintenance required to keep it alive1.Instead of charging a recurring subscription which is common practice for most software, even the kind that doesn't require much continual upkeep or incur big variable costs (and is a practice that isuniversallyhated), I decided to ask for a one-time contribution for Gather (that is completely optional) for its development2.The contribution screen is the last part in the "setup" flow. The default is $13 and the scale ranges from $3-$60.I decided to share my story and bring the people using Gather into my community. I wanted them to understand how much, not only their contribution, but their very use of the app was part of this interdependence. That I wasn't just a faceless company that doesn't care who signs up for their app outside of how they contribute to the revenue figures. I wanted them to know that each contribution had a face on it‚Äîone I would personally cherish.I didn't have much expectations. I figured just a few people would donate, and that would be that3. But the response has been incredible. Over 70 people have contributed something to use Gather, with an average payment of ~$11. There are less than 300 people signed up for the beta now, so it comes out to around 1/3 of the people using the app contributed something. It's more than I could have hoped for, and it's making me dream of a world where this might sustain my living expenses for a couple of months.Every time I am shocked by the willingness of people to help you when you ask for it. The community will support you if you ask them to. It will hold you if you open yourself to being held.Every day of this "independent" life further cements my belief that the network (as inmycelium) is everything. Everything I'm able to accomplish is made possible by someone else. I've started to depart from "independent" as a classifier and reaching instead for "indie" to distinguish myself from being supported through traditional employment at a company."We want independence, yes, but also interdependence."fromhttps://www.interdependence.online/Even as I say this, it's hard to change my language to reflect it. It's easy to think that I'm on my own and feel guilty about all the work I'm not able to do. That it's weak or even incompetent to ask for help. I even titled my reflection about a year of this freedom "a year of independence."One place that has always held space for the gratitude of indie makers is the Acknowledgements section lodged at the end of works, from writing to websites. I love reading through these letters wherever I find them to see how others manage to capture the gratitude for everyone in their lives who helped make their work possible. Do they acknowledge every single person who believed in them, critiqued their work, shared time with them, brought some tea or gave them a hug during the hardest moments? How can you capture all your gratitude in a single space?4I love seeing the personal, inside-joke messages that weave between the lines, how the author's writing voice starts to transform from a singular representation to a multifaceted, jumbled composition of the personalities of everyone they pull into the space as they thank them.Maybe we could acknowledge them in our very titles? Maybe we could be "in(ter)dependent" (fromMarcel Goethals) artists, researchers, engineers, technologists, and creatives?I have an old practice of acknowledging. A couple years ago, I started keeping a record of appreciations for people. There's not really a central repository for them‚ÄîI just tag them with "#appreciations" in the most accessible note-taking app at that time. Whenever I feel gratitude for someone, I record their name followed by what part of them I'm feeling grateful for. I wrote a little script to extract these, and I've been thinking about sharing them with people on their birthday (or perhaps every season?). There's the seed of something beautiful here. How would you adopt this practice and how else would you share it with the people you love to thank them?Latest NewsGatheris available for anyone to try oniOSandAndroid. I'd love to hear your thoughts. You can read more about it and my broader computing philosophy in thiswonderful interviewMeg and Cab from Are.na conducted with me.I'm headed to London and Berlin for a couple weeks in mid-July. I'd love to hear recommendations and if you know ofvenueswhere I could host a webstone workshop!With Gather released, I'm heads-down working on my installation, AcknowledgeNET, a piece honoring how much of our labor makes up the Internet, forGray Area's Artist Showcaseon July 10 and 11th in San Francisco. If you're free come by to see it and 10+ other works :)I'm starting to explore the possibilities of creating a small batch ofcomputing-infusedceramic objects monthly as another way to make rent (more thoughts on this whole tension with money soon.. lol).

I might send some gentle reminders after continued use, but I haven't implemented it yet.2Although I've been encouraged to also ask for some sort of recurring contribution to support updating of dependencies and changing phone OS versions that will require consistent work every year, so I've been thinking of adding a link out for people to do so in very small amounts like $5-30annually. I don't know maybe this is still too small to justify maintaining it. I have a tough time reconciling how much we've become normalized to pay for software (hundreds of dollars per month to send emails) and simultaneously how much we've come to expect software to be free when it requires active labor to maintain. If you make an indie game that becomes wildly played, the millions who play it subsidize the cost for everyone else. The low variable cost of software means that you can only charge a low price if you go big. I haven't figured out how to reconcile this with makingpersonal, handmade softwarefor your community.3in fact I probably wouldn't even have launched with this screen without the encouragement ofCab, whose nudge I'm now incredibly grateful for4I‚Äôd love to see examples of acknowledgements / credits that you love!
