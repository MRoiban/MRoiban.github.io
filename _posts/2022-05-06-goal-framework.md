# Why Habits are the Key?

Habits play a significant role in defining our lives. Everyday activities like sleeping, showering, and working out are all habitual actions.

When we aim to make a change in our lives, it often proves challenging, and the change doesn't last long. This could be due to the change being too drastic, overwhelming, or lacking the discipline and motivation needed to sustain it.

To bring about change, we must actively think about and implement it. In contrast, habits are easily performed and require minimal mental effort to initiate. Our bodies have become accustomed to these habits through repetition. Changes, on the other hand, go against what our bodies are used to, making it difficult to maintain them.

However, if changes are consistently maintained over a certain period of time, they can transform into habits. As a result, our bodies assimilate the change and it becomes easier to repeat the new behavior.

# How to Build Habits?

1. Set a clear and specific goal to guide your habit-building process and keep you focused.

2. Once you have established your goal, create a simplified version of it. This version should be extremely easy to accomplish. Remember, our bodies are accustomed to performing the same actions every day and resist change. By making the change easy, we minimize friction.

    - Example:
        - Goal: Workout three times a week for a total of three hours.
        - Watered down version: Engage in at least two minutes of exercise daily to get your body moving and accustomed to planned workouts.

3. Consistently practice the watered down version for at least 30 days. This allows your body to adapt and gradually form the habit.

4. After the initial period, start gradually progressing from the watered down version towards your original goal. Modify the habit slightly, adding small increments. Remember, the aim is to introduce as little friction as possible to help your body adapt to the change.

Utilizing habits to implement changes in our lives is highly effective as it facilitates easy adherence to the desired transformations.
