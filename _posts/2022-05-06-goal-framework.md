# Why Are Habits the Key?

Habits play a significant role in shaping our lives. Routine activities like sleeping, showering, and working out are all habitual actions that we perform with little thought.

When we aim to make a change in our lives, it often proves challenging, and the change doesnâ€™t last long. This is usually because the change is too drastic, overwhelming, or lacks the discipline and motivation needed to sustain it.

To bring about lasting change, we must actively think about and implement it. Habits, on the other hand, are easily performed and require minimal mental effort to initiate. Our bodies have become accustomed to these habits through repetition. In contrast, changes disrupt what our bodies are used to, making them difficult to maintain.

However, if a change is consistently practiced over a certain period, it can transform into a habit. As a result, our bodies assimilate the change, and it becomes easier to repeat the new behavior.

# How to Build Habits

1. **Set a Clear and Specific Goal:** Start by setting a clear and specific goal to guide your habit-building process and keep you focused.

2. **Create a Simplified Version of the Goal:** Once you have established your goal, break it down into a simplified version that is extremely easy to accomplish. Our bodies are resistant to change and prefer familiar routines. By making the change easy, you reduce resistance.

   **Example:**
   - **Goal:** Work out three times a week for a total of three hours.
   - **Simplified Version:** Engage in at least two minutes of exercise daily to get your body moving and accustomed to planned workouts.

3. **Consistent Practice:** Practice the simplified version consistently for at least 30 days. This allows your body to adapt and gradually form the habit.

4. **Gradual Progression:** After the initial period, gradually progress from the simplified version towards your original goal. Make small adjustments, adding incremental challenges. The aim is to introduce as little resistance as possible to help your body adapt to the change.

Utilizing habits to implement changes in our lives is highly effective, as it makes it easier to adhere to desired transformations.
